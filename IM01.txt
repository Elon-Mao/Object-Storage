[Scenario 1 | Mentor checks onboarding progress]
A: Hey, how’s it going with the React codebase so far?
B: Pretty good, still getting familiar with the structure.
A: Totally normal.
B: The components folder is a bit dense though.
A: Yeah, it takes some time.
B: I’m reading through the main container now.
A: Great, that’s a good starting point.
B: Let me know if I’m missing anything important.
A: Will do.
B: Thanks!

[Scenario 2 | Explaining component splitting]
A: Quick question — do you understand why we split this component?
B: Kind of, but I’m not fully sure.
A: No worries.
B: Is it mainly for reusability?
A: Exactly, and also readability.
B: That makes sense.
A: You’ll see this pattern a lot here.
B: Got it.
A: Feel free to ask anytime.
B: Appreciate it.

[Scenario 3 | Code style guidance]
A: Hey, I left a few comments on your PR.

A: No rush, just follow the team style.
B: Sure.
A: Overall, the logic looks solid.
B: Glad to hear that.
A: Ping me when you update it.
B: Will do.

[Scenario 4 | Explaining useEffect dependencies]
A: I noticed you’re unsure about the dependency array.
B: Yeah, I’m afraid of breaking something.
A: That’s very common.
B: How do you usually decide what goes in there?
A: Think about what should trigger the effect.
B: Okay.
A: If it’s used inside, it probably belongs there.
B: That helps.
A: We can refactor it together later.
B: Sounds good.

[Scenario 5 | New hire asks for help]
A: Hey, do you have a minute?
B: Sure, what’s up?
A: I’m stuck on this state update.
B: Which part?
A: The async logic inside the handler.
B: Okay, let’s walk through it.
A: Thanks.
B: You’re actually very close.
A: That’s reassuring.
B: We’ll fix it quickly.

[Scenario 6 | Task assignment and expectations]
A: For this ticket, just focus on the UI part.
B: No backend changes, right?
A: Correct.
B: Should I reuse existing components?
A: Yes, whenever possible.
B: Got it.
A: Don’t worry about edge cases yet.
B: Okay.
A: We’ll review it together.
B: Sounds great.

[Scenario 7 | Encouraging questions]
A: By the way, don’t hesitate to ask questions.
B: I was worried about interrupting.
A: Not at all.
B: Good to know.

B: That’s comforting.
A: Questions are actually encouraged.
B: I’ll keep that in mind.
A: Cool.
B: Thanks for saying that.

[Scenario 8 | Positive feedback after code review]
A: Nice job on the refactor.
B: Thanks!
A: The logic is much clearer now.
B: I tried to keep it simple.
A: And it shows.
B: Glad it works.
A: Just one minor tweak left.
B: Sure.
A: Overall, great progress.
B: Appreciate the feedback.

[Scenario 9 | Explaining overall project architecture]
A: Let me give you a quick overview of the app.
B: That would help a lot.
A: We separate features by domain.
B: Okay.
A: Shared logic goes into hooks.
B: Makes sense.
A: Pages are mostly composition layers.
B: Got it.
A: You’ll get used to it fast.
B: Looking forward to it.

[Scenario 10 | Wrapping up mentorship]
A: Alright, I think that covers it for today.
