139
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,919
also very hyped about what's going to

140
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,840
happen today because we seen we've seen

141
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,320
some of these matchups like the big

142
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,320
story lines coming into this TI the

143
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,279
whole 2023 was pretty much gaming

144
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,440
Gladiators against Team Liquid they had

145
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,240
to face in the lower bracket and

146
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,279
unfortunately one of them had to go home

147
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,360
they're still going to you know stay

148
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,760
here watch the grand finals but uh the

149
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,840
other thing is team spirit just

150
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,480
dominating whenever there's a lot of

151
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,159
money involved a lot of prestige you

152
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,440
know that this team they're going to

153
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,399
speed up they want to be the one you

154
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,600
know cring themselves as a second time

155
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,279
champion at TI I was just looking at yor

156
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,120
games and he's doing this once again

157
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,880
he's playing every game with a new hero

158
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,960
like he hero challenge again old hero

159
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,840
challenge again like the only two Heroes

160
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,840
that had like two repetition was like CK

161
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,600
and mua but other than that he's like

162
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,000
every game new here like troll s ter

163
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,080
blade you name it you know he's going

164
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,880
for this new play like he he doesn't

165
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,840
really like he doesn't like to play the

166
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,440
same Heroes yeah they running back the

167
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,240
style that uh gone in the a lot of

168
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
success for TI 10 you know the benefit

169
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,639
of being on the morning panel by the way

170
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,480
the opening the pre-show is that you can

171
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,760
put out who you think is going to win TI

172
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,880
out of these three remaining teams and

173
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,120
you get to look smarter than everyone

174
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,480
else that comes on later in the day so

175
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,679
do you want to give it a go do you want

176
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,240
to say your bold prediction it's a one

177
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,360
in three chance so it's 50% H just

178
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,159
kidding and I I do feel like team spirit

179
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:50,960
they've showed the best like map

180
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,720
movements their drats are always on

181
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,559
point how they play if you if you're

182
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,200
playing late game against team spirit

183
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,519
and we've seen a lot of these games

184
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,960
going the late game I feel like they're

185
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,120
going to take it but also between the

186
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,919
two teams that we're going to see right

187
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:05,200
now lgd gaming against gaming Gladiators

188
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,600
I feel you know G they have the upper

189
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,600
hand because they really stepping it up

190
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,799
ever since they played against nine

191
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,200
pandas all of their games are like 20 to

192
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,399
30 minute games pretty much I mean to me

193
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:16,840
the finals are going to be between

194
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,559
spirit and gaming to be honest yeah I

195
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,840
think I think lgd are not going to

196
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,320
handle the pressure from gaming

197
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,200
Gladiators like it's we had a few gaming

198
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,880
Gladiators fans that year when when you

199
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,679
said that they were going to be making

200
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,840
it to the fin sorry guys sorry to upset

201
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,440
you but yeah I mean uh the the gaming

202
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,200
they're like very good at laning and

203
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,480
it's been lgd struggle for like a long

204
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,880
time so I think uh they're not going to

205
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,960
be able to handle that pressure but for

206
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,919
the finals I think Spirit are like way

207
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,399
more solic very they're very adaptable

208
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,440
and um I'm I think this is the only one

209
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,240
team that who can stop the gaming ler

210
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,880
from like you know doing the same thing

211
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,760
and like because they're also very good

212
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,039
at laning and if you're good at laning

213
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,600
and that that time it doesn't really

214
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,159
work when you're like on even terms I

215
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,559
think there's also a comparison cuz

216
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,760
spirit is probably the best team at

217
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,039
playing from behind in this tournament

218
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,279
no matter how bad the game is they can

219
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,440
still win you feel like they're going to

220
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,320
win even if they're down a lot and so

221
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,399
for gaming a lot of their ways they win

222
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,159
is just early game pressure and just

223
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,880
taking over the game so fast but I think

224
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,320
Spirits probably if there's one team to

225
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,919
beat that' be Spirit okay all right so

226
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,320
we're all kind of putting a lot of eggs

227
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,440
in the Teen Spirit basket they had to be

228
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,919
repeat TI winners but it's a long day

229
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,559
ahead of us we don't know what is going

230
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,559
to happen but we're going to start this

231
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,760

291
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,319
interview per minute was at that rate I

292
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:58,599
feel a little bitet at there's like no

293
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:00,760
uh not a lot of lgd fans were there and

294
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,640
at this moment I'm sure there's a lot of

295
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,359
in the crowd right now can we hear them

296
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:07,839
guys anyone lgd fans yeah that that's

297
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,280

298
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,359
want to know I want to know gaming

299
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,280
Gladiator fans

300
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,920
though oh they're a little bit louder

301
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,520
and what about team spirit

302
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,200
guys okay I didn't think we were going

303
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,160
to get that loud of team spirit chance

304
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,720
until later we know that they're already

305
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,040
in the grand finals I thought all the

306
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,359
Teen Spirit fans might have been getting

307
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,760
their sleeping getting their gamer hours

324
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,160
to want to be in the background

325
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,920
Charlotte theater is where I heard it's

326
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,040
been taken place so it' be nice to see

327
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,599

cosplay that will be taking place

329
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,880
between the low bracket finals and the

330
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,960
grand finals so there is action all

331
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,040
throughout the day nothing that you guys

332
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,839
want to miss at all and there's already

333
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,400
been a lot of action cost oh absolutely

334
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,359
we're talking about to DOTA action like

335
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:28,400
You' even seen like this this whole meta

336
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,480
shift that has been going on ever since

337
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,520
the group stage started where you had

338
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,079
all these tanky midlaners off laners

339
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:36,760
with the blade M heart and then you had

340
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,760
like some of these strong offlane Duos

341
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,079
with vber plus grimstroke that has risen

342
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:42,960
at the recent uh stages of the

343
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,200
tournament Tusk bu Dawn breaker and also

344
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,960
some of these untargetable Heroes and

345
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,599
then there's a separate meta that gaming

346
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,920
gladers are playing which is constant

347
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,480
push like they're just going for these

348
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,119
20-minute games picking all these pretty

349
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,440
much Heroes that they've been playing

350
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,160
throughout the whole year just switching

351
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,359
things up a little bit bringing out Chen

352
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:01,960
which is you know undefeated in their

353
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,640
hand so far and I think this might be

354
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,040
the hero to look out for in this

355
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,520
particular Sero because both of these

356
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,680
teams are undefeated with the hero and

357
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,040
also this is the hero when gaming

358
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,599
Gladiators they lost a chin when they

359
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,880
met in the group stage I just think it's

360
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,200
really scary for non-gaming gladiators

361
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,680
today cuz every other team is so used to

362
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,720
buying Midas going late game and gaming

363
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,560
will you do that so hopefully everyone

364
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,079
did their homework and they're ready to

365
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,680
not lose in 20 minutes like I did to

366
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,480
gaming and they can beat them

367
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,920
it feels so bad when you say it like

368
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,800
that we're like all up game gladies and

369
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,480
then it's the reality like yeah we had

370
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,520
to face that that was our first uh patch

371
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,240
up in the main stage it is what it is it

372
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,440
is what it is re what how do you feel

373
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,040
about the The Meta shift and some new

374
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,720
Heroes that we're seeing mostly at this

375
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,760
main stage I just love when teams are

376
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,040
innovating right uh when they when you

377
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,319
come into the games and you really

378
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:50,160
expect like what's going to happen lgd I

379
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,640
think they have that like they pulled

380
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,319
the Tinker in the last series against

381
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:55,000
Spirit it was pretty good game like they

382
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,160
could have won easily it was like

383
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,319
70-minute game again but the gaming

384
00:38:58,319 --> 00:38:59,800
glider they're like they're in

385
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,440
innovating like every game they're

386
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,280
bringing new Heroes like they have this

387
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,319
trick like play style that they invented

388
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:07,160
but they also like Innova in terms of

389
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,240
Heroes as well because they brought a

390
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,720
hoscar yesterday as well and they

391
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,640
brought the Underlord back from the you

392
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,480
know nobody picked that hero for a long

393
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,920
time so they're like they're thinking

394
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,280
about like they have the structure of

395
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,560
like how they want to play but they're

396
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,640
still like adding on top of it new new

397
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,839
stuff and I'm I'm like for Spirit for

398
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:24,440
example they're like very solid very

399
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,680
steady but they're not like very

400
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,000
Innovative in that sense the only Magnus

401
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,680
but I mean everybody's playing Magnus

402
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,920
right now it's also collaps Magnus yeah

403
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,079
kind of classic a little bit of cheat in

404
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,960
that there were a lot of teams yesterday

405
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,160
though that had that Innovation too I

406
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,079
remember b boom they brought out the

407
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,960
Dragonite a hero that hadn't been picked

408
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,599
at ti2 yet so we saw yesterday we

409
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,560
started yesterday with six teams we

410
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,359
ended yesterday with three teams if you

411
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,160
missed it luckily for you we have a

412
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,640
little bit of a recap and we get to see

413
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,000
all the highlights of the action that

414
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,680
took place in day two here at climate

415
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,920
pledge arino

416
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,960
to die in the footstep of his own

417
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,000
Fountain yes Ultra kill for Daio will

418
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,079
chasing the dawn breaker ultimate coming

419
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,720
in for the

420
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,599
turn collapse you cannot be

421
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,400
underestimated Team

422
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,720
Liquid versus game in

423
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,520
Gladiators you don't want to give up

424
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,000
this ran celery deep in the corner how

425
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,520
do you get this guy out of here

426
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,000
that's beautiful but immediately the bkb

427
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,440
going off they are doing a lot of damage

428
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,400

429
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,720

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,960
theeler do on through the pit but he

431
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,960
missed the ages Luna Siege it is all the

432
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,599
more dangerous once your tier three is

433
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,000
down and you start getting those bouny

434
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,200
Glades into play trying to pull Dau out

435
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,560
of position almost got him but he pushed

436
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,119
a little bit over to the side instead

437
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,480
Harpoon pulling in the

438
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,400
kuna this one up he has no bkb you got

439
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,520
to remember this going to be D straight

440
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,319

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,000
they are absolutely going to be losing

446
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,160
four here meanwhile mid lane they are

447
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,760
fighting this one out Quinn once again

00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,359
man the block The Shield is just enough

451
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:18,079
they get celery out of it but Nick he's

452
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,680
going to be in trouble as soon as Z dies

453
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,480
they're going to turn all their

454
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,319
attention over this guy the the he gets

455
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:26,599

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,160
enough to stay alive though the stun is

460

461
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,960

466
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,720
sight there for a turnar around the

467
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,040
fight it's lasted too long this is where

476
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:24,079
gpk trying to

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,920
run is too strong

478
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,119
they see gpk decide to jump on him to

479
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,599

team spirit versus

491
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,079
LGT

492
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,280
gaming they're stepping out of the base

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,880
here he's able to get the jump get the

494
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,040

Gladiators verus

516
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,640
aure Theo getting healed from the

517
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,839
sideline from tofu they're going to have

518
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:15,839
to do a lot more healing than that

519
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:16,680
they're going to be able to kill off the

520
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,800
edge eventually as chalice is now going

521
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,200
to die and just like that it's a five

522
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,079
versus three so their racks will end up

523
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,640
falling at 18 and2 minutes gaming

524
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,920
Gladiator playing way too fast for a r

525
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,280
to handle oh L's not going to be too

526
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,800
happy with the beginning of this game

527
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,160
holy Jesus those the biggest inner fire

528
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,000
I've ever seen already three kills for

529
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,200

530
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:49,280

00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,800
that's our three remaining teams there

533
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,160
we sold them lgd gaming Gladiators and

534
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,559
team spirit yesterday we did see liid b

535
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:09,119
boom and Aur Ray end their TI 12 run

536
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,119
they should be extremely happy with

537
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,400
where they placed because it was a tough

538
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,240
run for themselves tough opponents all

539
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,200
around and that is how our bracket is

540
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,960
shaping up did you guys do your bracket

541
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,720

I don't I don't know if I have to

545
00:45:29,319 --> 00:45:32,040
explain the other winners in the finals

546
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,319
I think I had a jur ray reaching top

547
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,440
three but that didn't happen but after

548
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,960
what happened yesterday these guys we

549
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,119
got to give them credit after they lost

550
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:41,720
first they managed to win against b boom

551
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,960

00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,880
some all chat some question marks in the

553
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,440
all chat and after that seems like the

554
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,599
job was done you know they came here to

555
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,359
play they came here to beat the bed boom

556
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,960
and then you know this is the team that

557
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,839
formed pretty much this is the streamer

558
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:56,559
team when they wanted to you know show

559
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:57,960
that they can still do it on the main

560
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,119
stage these are the players that don't

561
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,920
receive salaries some of them and they

562
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,520
just wanted to do it for fun they lost

563
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,079
big smiles on their faces and I think we

564
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:07,800
got to give give credit and big Applause

565
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,359
for what they've managed to do at this

566
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,359
di yeah the other team I wanted to

567
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,760
mention is uh liquid because they're the

568
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,280
the only one who actually managed to

569
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,680
take down games from both gaming and the

570
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,000
spirit so they're like I think for to me

571
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,319
at least they're deserving to be like in

572
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:23,760
the top three to top four but you know

573
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,200
because the bracket happened to be that

574
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,839
way he they actually eliminated already

575
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,839
so but it's sad it's sad to have have

576
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,960
them go a lot of really good showings I

577
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,119
want to talk about fantastic showings

578
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,920
though enough to break TI records okay

579
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,200
it's been a wild month and so we've had

580
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,000
some oldtime TI records set during this

581
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,280
TI 12 so in a single match these are our

582
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,720
new records that we created this year

583
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,839
throughout the 3 weeks TA 2000 getting

584
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:56,960
two TI records for himself new as well k

585
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,400
in it's in the same game TA 2000 he did

586
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,480
play nasar and broke those records he's

587
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,480
an insane player usually when we talk

588
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,640
about TA 2000 he was the guy that plays

589
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,440
these Agy carry Heroes but he also

590
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,119
Shines on some of these melee Heroes as

591
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,680
well and also as you've seen Neo Doom

592
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,040
GPM this guy is just a monster I mean

593
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,440
he's been the driving force of the new

594
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,760
lgd as well calling some of these shots

595
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,880
and you know TI 23 23 leers kage on his

596
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,359
Spectre he also broke a couple of

597
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,160
Records in that game as well this guy is

598
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,680
just insane really glad that ver Pro

599
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,040
Show some Top Class DOA at TI I like the

600
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,640
Nightfall one 334 map pings yeah they're

601
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,280
by far the team that pings the most

602
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,599
they're like 600 and everybody then

603
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,240
there's like Talon with 400 and

604
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,760
everybody else that I mean you can

605
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,119
expect this yeah if you play pubz with

606
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:44,280
Nightfall you know that he loves just

607
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,240
pinging and talking you can know like

608
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,839
you kind of know how he's on a team just

609
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,000
of how much he talks in games and pubs

610
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,880
cuz you always talk more in real games

611
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,720
and pubs so if he talks a lot in pubs

612
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,040
I'm sure his pings are just crazy in a

613
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,880
tournament it's also the most skilled

614
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,559
stat right there on the spot because you

615
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,680
know you have to have a skill to Ping

616
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,559
300 times a game but other St like you

617
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:08,440
know Naga 1,000 GPM like it's whatever

618
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,000
like it's long game like we all know

619
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,960
that but the pinks it's a skill the the

620
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,440
snaking one was interesting as well very

621
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,440
quickly because it's now no longer the

622
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,599
longest game so it makes more sense if

623
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:20,240
you had the longest game placing that

624
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,359
many obser awards would make sense but

625
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:23,800
now no longer the longest game but still

626
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,359
holds that record for this te as the

627
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,640
most observe Awards placed uh look I

628
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,960
don't really have a segue for this one

629
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,520
all I'm going to say is I'm excited to

630
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,640
hear a little bit more about some meta

631
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,079
changes some big heroes that showed up

632
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,359
yesterday and to give us that

633
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:39,280
information it's

634
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,800
pedge thanks everybody yeah we have a

635
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,240
huge match coming up today uh lgd coming

636
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,599
from the winter bracket they've played

637
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,200
the entire tournament with a unique

638
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,160
style they've been playing up meta they'

639
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,000
bought few hand amitis compared to the

640
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,920
other teams and it rewarded them heavily

641
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,440
they won the vast majority of their

642
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,200
games until yesterday where they

643
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,480
faltered a little bit now and uh one

644
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,200
thing that was trending for them in the

645
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,839
previous matches is they were winning

646
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,880
with Magnus in almost every series that

647
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,200
they played it and surprisingly uh they

648
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,079
didn't ban Spirit breaker uh xia said

649
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,720
that he didn't think the hero was

650
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,440
overpowered now he's a big spammer so

651
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,160
he's probably just biased here but it's

652
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,000
a seventh most banned hero for the

653
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,640
entire tournament so far so the fact

654
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,079
that they finally banned it for the

655
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,559
first time yesterday means that meta is

656
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,319
shifting a little bit and maybe lgd is

657
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,240
feeling less confident in their ideas

658
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,799
now that they're getting some losses and

659
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,040
in terms of the Magnus what had

660
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,799
accomplished they won three of their

661
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:33,440
last uh series with the Magnus but this

662
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,880
one yesterday was a little bit too tough

663
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,520
they got behind in the laning stage

664
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,799
against team spirit's Farm heavy style

665
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:41,119
and normally you would think that their

666
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,960
High Tempo play style would be able to

667
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,240
beat that but in every single one of

668
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,480
these clips even though they're getting

669
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,440
successful kills they are still behind

670
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,599
in net worth because team spirit was so

671
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,359
good at playing the map here this is a

672
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,440
clip we saw earlier in one of the uh the

673
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,760
highlight reels but this is a great

674
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,480
moment they killed the enemy carry with

675
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,839
a great RP Magnus has been successful

676
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:00,400
yesterday in getting these grabs that

677
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,839
are difficult to snag and giving really

678
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:05,160
solid team fight power but team spirit

679
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,440
was just too good against it so

680
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,960
hopefully for lgd they don't falter from

681
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,040
their ideas and their confidence after

682
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,960
their loss yesterday and we'll see how

683
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,240
they can do against gaming Gladiators

684
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,599
who so far has looked pretty

685
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,559
Unstoppable thank you so much Purge

only doing Adam my's middle name but uh

756
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,119
that he's a game of Gladiators fan for a

757
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,920
good reason I I mean he made the their

758
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,040
their days shorter you know they were

759
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,680
long days and he's like you know I want

760
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,720
to get this camera it's pretty heavy but

761
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,400
uh yeah really glad that now we know his

762
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,400
middle name yeah well look we'll see

763
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,880
when gaming Gladiator is are playing

764
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,720
we're going to have schedule you get to

765
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,599
see we already know that they're in the

766
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:00,880
top three but we're going to see that

767
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,480
they are in the first series here so

768
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,359
they are up against lgd and then

769
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:08,000
potentially another long day for

770
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,880
themselves up against team spirit if

771
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,040
they do make it through they already had

772
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,640
a marathon of a day yesterday they were

773
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,480
first and fourth Series

774
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,400
yesterday I just hope that daa feels way

775
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,200
better today because he was very sick

776
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,559
yesterday and he still managed to

777
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,359
perform like insanely well he was like

778
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:25,359
15012 on the Vier game last one and it

779
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,680
was like after for the second series

780
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,240
they already played they're walking

781
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,559
confidently can we see the Raa no oh

782
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:34,920
yeah you can kind of see him a little

783
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,640
bit in the back there but uh Ace is

784
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,040
leading the charge he's doing all the

785
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,440
signatures uh for the team of gaming

786
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,440
gladiators but lgd this bounce back for

787
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,680
them actually I'm going to change this

788
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,040
let's just talk about all the carries

789
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,359
okay because there's still three teams

790
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:50,720
left we don't necessarily have to talk

791
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,200
about this exact matchup right now

792
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,920
because we could be seeing any iteration

793
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,000
of the grand finals so we have a car

794
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,880
comparison here we still got Daio left

795
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,520
in the B you already talked about res he

796
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,760
might be feeling a little bit under the

797
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,359
weather despite how good of a

798
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:03,880
performance he had yesterday there's

799
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,680
still the chance it affects him shirou

800
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,000
is the carry for lgd and then yor of

801
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,839
course being the carry for teen spirit

802
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,559
so this is their hero pool of what they

803
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:14,480
played at ti2 and their average kills

804
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,319
deaths and assists over the course of

805
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,200
this tournament theal set here is that

806
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,280
they they both like all all of them like

807
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,440
have pretty similar death rate which is

808
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,160
uh kind of insane because yoro like is

809
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,200
playing like longer games with shirro

810
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,359
but but for D it's like the same rate

811
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:30,319
considering the theay the games are like

812
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,680
finishing like within 20 to 30 minutes

813
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,400
because like this guy he's playing Super

814
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,240
aggressive and he's not afraid like he

815
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,720
he said it multiple times he's not

816
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,480
afraid to die he's just doing whatever

817
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,039
his team is needed and he's he has like

818
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:44,440
full confidence of like Quinn and Ace

819
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,359
like you know following up and not dying

820
00:55:46,359 --> 00:55:47,960
like and and carrying the game for him

821
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,480
as well you can also see Spirit and lgd

822
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,440
have this 45 46 minute average timing

823
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,039
where gaming you know they're finishing

824
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:56,000
the games on average a lot quicker and

825
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,760
so so that's kind of where you see yoro

826
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,240
get a lot more kills on average but I

827
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,440
also think it's impressive that he's

828
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,160
managing to die pretty much the same

829
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,119
amount of times with more games or more

830
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:05,799
time being played in the game yeah we

831
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:08,200
also had their shortest games 19 29 and

832
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,880
30 minutes respectively so that's

833
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,599
massive G Gladiators getting a 19-minute

834
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,160
win for themselves yeah it's pretty

835
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,039
insane what they can do when they get

836
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:16,520
the hands on the heroes that they like

837
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,960
to play and they it feels like they they

838
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,640
got the heroes that they wanted in the

839
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,440
last eight games they played because

840
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,000
they wanted to speed things up they're

841
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,400
bringing out these enchantresses this

842
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,799
chin and we've seen Thea you know having

843
00:56:27,799 --> 00:56:29,680
slightly more deaths because this guy is

844
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,640
nuts like I really love to watch this

845
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,559
guy play DotA cuz you mentioned the

846
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:35,440
vaver game yesterday where he was diving

847
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,640
Tower four minutes in he's on tier 2

848
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,000
Tower he's building earn of Shadows on a

849
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,480
carry something that we've seen only on

850
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,920
Spectre pretty much he wants to keep

851
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,039
this aggression this is the team that

852
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:46,640
once they realize that you're bleeding

853
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,720
your lanes are bleeding they're not

854
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,640
going to let you go I also like the way

855
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,720
he's walking on the stage like d he he

856
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,599
always feels that you know that love

857
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:55,319
from the crown he's like putting his

858
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:57,079
hands up like you know know give me that

859
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:58,920
love and he he wants to have that

860
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,400
attention right and then I think for G

861
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,319
for the lgd the biggest challenge right

862
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:04,880
now for this series is going to be like

863
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,640
how strong of the lanes they can get

864
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,079
because this is the team that they're

865
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,760
focusing like on this mid game

866
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,480
strategies and like how their Heroes

867
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,200
synergize well between each other but to

868
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,680
me the most important thing is like how

869
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,599
are they going to get out from the lanes

870
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,280
today I think with uh their draft from

871
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,599
yesterday I'm hoping that lgd kind of

872
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,599
changes things up they picked slow

873
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,039
Heroes I think for Spirit which was fine

874
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:26,680
the games went really long they had a

875
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,680
tinker yesterday a spectre and I'm

876
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,359
hoping for them to pick faster paced

877
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:32,480
Heroes kind of adapt maybe they take the

878
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,680
tides the Chens the inches or conas

879
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,960
something that allows them to fight

880
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,079
gaming Gladiators really early on cuz I

881
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,920
think if you're able to contest them and

882
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,520
you drag the game out longer that's how

883
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,720
you have the ability to actually beat

884
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,240
this team how quick is it to make that

885
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,799
adjustment though I think for a caliber

886
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,359
team like lgd they can probably do it a

887
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:50,319
night uh like an afternoon oh really

888
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,880
that quick okay they have one of the

889
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,880
best coaches in the world they have

890
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,440
xiawei so he's probably cooking

891
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,079
something up right now he's probably

892
00:57:57,079 --> 00:57:58,599
telling the boys what they're going to

893
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:00,200
do just trust me I'll draft you

894
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,039
something to win and hopefully they win

895
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:04,200
yeah look they've had a couple days to

896
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,680
see that tempo of gaming Gladiators

897
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,200
we'll see how they do Fair up but before

898
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,319
we do anything else we have to get our

899
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,880
day started so let's do it let's make

900
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,319

Gladiators the lower bracket dominators

943
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,760
they have knocked out five teams already

944
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,000
they've been here since the first round

945
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,200
and here they are on the final day

946
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,799
walking to their Booth they're going to

947
01:01:07,799 --> 01:01:10,200
have to win and they're going to have to

948
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:15,760
face lgd if they want to continue

lgd

957
01:01:47,799 --> 01:01:50,680
gaming they face a team of spirit

958
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,160
yesterday it was a tough loss for them

959
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,119
but they have a second life they can go

960
01:01:56,119 --> 01:01:58,160
up against team spirit in the grand

961
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,559
finals again if they do become Victors

962
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:03,880
in this lower bracket finals but for the

963
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,520
first time in ti2 they're on the edge of

964
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,960
elimination they're going to have to

965
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,440
pull out everything in this best of

966
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,599
three and gunana you talked about what

967
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:14,279
changes are going to have to happen and

968
01:02:14,279 --> 01:02:15,599
the fact that they are one of the best

969
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,920
coaches to make it happen for them yeah

970
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,000
I really think the draft is going to

971
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,039
play the biggest part both teams already

972
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,400
proved their players are good enough to

973
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,119
just be here and they don't need to do

974
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:25,720
anything special so it's going to break

975
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,720
down to the draft mostly and we'll see I

976
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,960
think gaming Gladiators have a really

977
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,200
good read on the meta of the tournament

978
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,680
and kind of just breaking it compared to

979
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,359
everyone else playing really fast and

980
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:35,520
I've really like the way they draft it

981
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,559
seems really hard to beat them in the

982
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:38,640
draft so I think if lgd can even get an

983
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,799
even draft with a good you know tempo

984
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,839
for the game it'll be they'll be in a

985
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:44,680
good position mhm look we we pulled all

986
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,240
the extra stops for this lower bracket

987
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,920
finals to help us with the draft as well

988
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,000
we got chiefstick joining us by the way

989
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,599
can we get a round of applause for her

990
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,640
crowd yeah that's what I thought thanks

991
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,880
that hi yeah I just appeared out of

992
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,440
nowhere you really did yeah La Costa is

993
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,240
gone now sorry you just ate him you

994
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,640
consumed him and you're like I'm taking

995
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,680
his spot here and you're going to help

996
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,960
us talk about gaming gladiate is lgd for

997
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,839
the lower bracket Grand finals do you

998
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,400
agree with Gunner that they're able to

999
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,400
make this uh change in tempo for

1000
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,880
themselves despite the really rough loss

1001
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,279
especially that 76 minute game yesterday

1002
01:03:16,279 --> 01:03:17,480
oh my God watching that was

1003
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,160
heartbreaking for lgd uh I believe that

1004
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,920
they are a super top team obviously

1005
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,760
coming this far I think when we saw them

1006
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,480
play against azra Ray it was kind of

1007
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,680
like uh there that they exampled how

1008
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,079
they lost the early game but they really

1009
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:30,559
understood their timings they really

1010
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,559
understood uh where they wanted to go

1011
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,119
with their team and they the moves that

1012
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:35,799
they pulled off to kind of bring back

1013
01:03:35,799 --> 01:03:37,400
and equalize the game and then take the

1014
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,200
advantage and win and just close it out

1015
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,000
very cleanly without throws like that's

1016
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,680
the lgd I want to see coming here smart

1017
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,079
disciplined and ready to own yeah but uh

1018
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:48,599
they're not facing that R they're facing

1019
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:50,760
gaming gladers who are RAR making any

1020
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,480
mistakes right they're just like very

1021
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,880
confident going objective after

1022
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,520
objective and if they're not confident

1023
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:56,920
that can break it they're not going to

1024
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,200
go for it they're not going to give the

1025
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,079
chances so it's it's a very different uh

1026
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:04,000
game we're going to witness here it's

1027
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,720
tough to know what is going to be their

1028
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,119
win conditions before we see their

1029
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:08,799
drafts but I want to talk about stable

1030
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:11,039
players for them who has been the most

1031
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,799
consistent in showing up and I feel for

1032
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,640
both these teams it's the off laners

1033
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,039
it's Ace it's new for both teams new is

1034
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,079
also really new to this team uh he only

1035
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,760
came in off to two or three you're

1036
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,880
laughing cuz new is new new is new yeah

1037
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,799
I thought so I thought you'd have a

1038
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,240
little bit of giggle over that one

1039
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,920
but yeah he he's quite new to this team

1040
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,279
but he slaughtered in perfectly and

1041
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:30,880
there are a lot of games that I saw him

1042
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,920
being the an the one that's holding down

1043
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,839
the for for them holding those defenses

1044
01:04:34,839 --> 01:04:37,200
to allow shirou that time to be able to

1045
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,760
build what he needs on his carry I think

1046
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,880
the offlaners that are left in this

1047
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,960
tournament are very like stable and all

1048
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,760
of their like initiation power like

1049
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,599
they're doing it very well and very

1050
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,920
methodically and uh for new like even

1051
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,680
Centaur game yesterday he was carrying

1052
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,680
the game so hard on the hero that you

1053
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,440
would not expect that to have that much

1054
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,240
of an impact so that makes like him

1055
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,039
incredible like skilled player that

1056
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,319
knows his timing very well and also like

1057
01:04:59,319 --> 01:05:02,440
you know he he delivers so this is like

1058
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,200
this is the strength of their team like

1059
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,279
for sure also during last CH qualifier

1060
01:05:06,279 --> 01:05:07,359
last year people were singing his

1061
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:08,760
Praises new and they were saying you

1062
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,559
know he's going to be on the best

1063
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:11,599
Chinese team by the next TI and here he

1064
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,160
is he's proving himself at TI he's

1065
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,440
already top three so I definitely think

1066
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,720
that the off liners for both of these

1067
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,000
teams are kind of their like rocks where

1068
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,400
no matter how the game is going they're

1069
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,440
going to win their Lanes they're going

1070
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,440
to have a very stable game and always do

1071
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,039
their job kind of no matter the draft no

1072
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:27,000
matter the hero out of the situation

1073
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,640
yeah I really want to highlight as well

1074
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:29,920
it's not just the off laner it's who

1075
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,920
you're laning with the PA Falls I think

1076
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,839
new uh prior to this team he played on V

1077
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:36,520
gaming he played with FY now he's

1078
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,599
playing with Planet who not as big of a

1079
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:41,000
name known but I think planet is easily

1080
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,039
one of the best uh PA four players I've

1081
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,079
seen this year playing this guy is

1082
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:47,160
phenomenal um I would hype him up any

1083
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,480
chance I got last yesterday I was or two

1084
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,039
days ago I was saying I want to see

1085
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:52,799
planet rubic we saw it he owned with it

1086
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,279
he's the only guy winning with it really

1087
01:05:54,279 --> 01:05:55,880
in this tournament I think planet is

1088
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,359
amazing and seeing him and you laying

1089
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:59,079
together have been I mean they've just

1090
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:00,960
been destroying yeah I want to ask a

1091
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,079
question off the back of that then

1092
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:03,760
because we talked about the stable off

1093
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,119
laners as a mid player Gunner how

1094
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:07,720
important is it to have a stable off

1095
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,520
laner that allows your pause for to do

1096
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,200
so much or is it not so much for you as

1097
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,000
it is important for your safe Lane it

1098
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,599
matters honestly for all three lanes if

1099
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:16,480
you win your off Lane it allows the five

1100
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,799
to rotate through the gate right now

1101
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:19,520
gank the carry it allows the fours to

1102
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,920
check the water runes the power runes at

1103
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,520
6 8 minutes and kind of everything I

1104
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,599
think if you win your off Lane it almost

1105
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,720
wins your other two lanes just for you

1106
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,079
and it's really hard these days to just

1107
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:30,599
Stomp the mid and a pure One V one we've

1108
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:31,799
honestly seen it the last two days which

1109
01:06:31,799 --> 01:06:33,039
was very surprising that the mid lane

1110
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:34,839
match ups went really bad we saw the

1111
01:06:34,839 --> 01:06:36,400
Dragonite vers Puck we saw the void vers

1112
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,760
Puck so maybe it's just Puck not the mid

1113
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,240
lane but they've kind of had rough times

1114
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,880
where the game snowball out of control

1115
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,520
but I wouldn't expect that today I think

1116
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,200
it's more so going to be mid lane stable

1117
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,160
and whether s side Lanes kind of

1118
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,839
snowball one way or the other also

1119
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:50,520
concering how important the laning are

1120
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,920
right now like if it's really important

1121
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,480
to have the Synergy between position

1122
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,039
three and four like same as like a safe

1123
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,319
Lane and and you you almost like need to

1124
01:06:57,319 --> 01:07:00,119
have like those two uh players to be

1125
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:02,160
like a friend because like it was it was

1126
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,720
the same for me when I was playing with

1127
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,799
Z like we had an incredible incredible

1128
01:07:05,799 --> 01:07:09,039
like uh you know working working

1129
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:10,640
together time because like we we

1130
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,039
understood each other very well we are

1131
01:07:12,039 --> 01:07:13,400
friends and this is like what's

1132
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,200
important for for these players as well

1133
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,880
like to have that Synergy and like you

1134
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,400
know talk talk with about mistakes like

1135
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,400
improve on laning and understand each

1136
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,119
other without even War sometimes how

1137
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:26,279
would you compare uh Quinn and nothing

1138
01:07:26,279 --> 01:07:28,799
to say in the mid lane whether it's hero

1139
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,279
pool whether it's the importance their

1140
01:07:31,279 --> 01:07:33,119
team places on them how would you

1141
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,920
describe them or compare them

1142
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,440
G uh they're honestly pretty different

1143
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,240
myths I think Quinn when you think of

1144
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,039
him you think of him as more either a

1145
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,760
spirit or a counter pick like he played

1146
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,319
huskar and he plays the necros these

1147
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:47,839
like kind of annoying Heroes that just

1148
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,559
you feel it feels really bad to players

1149
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,279
and I would say nothing to say outside

1150
01:07:52,279 --> 01:07:54,359
of his Tinker I think he's a lot more of

1151
01:07:54,359 --> 01:07:56,240
he just plays his good Heroes

1152
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,559
uh he's really confident playing just

1153
01:07:57,559 --> 01:07:59,200
the same Heroes all the all the time he

1154
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,960
plays Ember Pango he plays a lot of

1155
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,240
Magnus for a really long time which is

1156
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,000
kind of coming back in this tournament

1157
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,240
so I think for Quinn you're looking more

1158
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,440
for this guy to Snowball the game for

1159
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,640
you and win the game for you and nothing

1160
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,160
to say to just have a solid game plan

1161
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,000
all right we'll see if they're going to

1162
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,440
draft around that if we're going to see

1163
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,400
any new picks for them or what's going

1164
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,319
to be banned as we do have our lower

1165
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:20,120
bracket Grand final game

1166
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,199
one G

1167
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:23,799
lgd

1168
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:26,040
gaming versus

1169
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,600
game in

1170
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,279
Gladiators game one

1171
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:35,359
second Ben bristle is what the audience

1172
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,319
is saying how much uh weight would you

1173
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:40,640
put into that one G uh for lgd I think

1174
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,799
bristle is one a Gaming's best

1175
01:08:41,799 --> 01:08:43,719
strategies especially cuz it's Ace you

1176
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:45,120
allow Ace to get a carrier in the off

1177
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,560
Lane that's pretty much his bread and

1178
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,400
butter he plays lone he he used to be a

1179
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,000
carry so it's not surprising that he's

1180
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,239
able to play the carries in the off Lane

1181
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:53,400
win his Lane and just have a stable game

1182
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:54,759
I don't think bristle be is letting

1183
01:08:54,759 --> 01:08:57,520
through guys ever ever again I think

1184
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,920
that here is way too hard to deal with

1185
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,239
and uh you know when AA is B and like

1186
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:05,359
what is the best answer for ug against

1187
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,120
this hero so I think one of the big

1188
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,920
reasons why bristle is so strong is his

1189
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,679
counters are also meta so it ends up

1190
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,199
that the Primal Beast gets banned the

1191
01:09:12,199 --> 01:09:13,839
Phoenix gets banned the a gets banned

1192
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:15,359
and so all of your responses to bristle

1193
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,040
are just banned do the nature of the

1194
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,000
draft and so it's just a strong hero now

1195
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,040
yeah and the Viper and hoodwin are not

1196
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,400
yeah the other ways to break him and

1197
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,080
reduce his HP region don't really exist

1198
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,000
anymore

1199
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,400
so I love what lgd did against Bristol

1200
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,600
back when they were playing they had

1201
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,319
this Magnus and they always like break

1202
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:32,799
his position because he's always in the

1203
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,839
front and they they managed to take him

1204
01:09:34,839 --> 01:09:36,839
with the Cur like way back into his own

1205
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,359
team and then muera like with extra

1206
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,120
damage to to stop that hero it actually

1207
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,199
works but and also you don't get damage

1208
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:44,799
from when you're in ulti you don't get

1209
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:47,159
damage from spills but uh yeah it's not

1210
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:49,640
going to be seen anytime soon I see the

1211
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,199
ENT and the Chen band here so a lot of

1212
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:53,920
importance placed on taking out what

1213
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,199
they deem is seler's most confident and

1214
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:00,120
Broken Heroes but now I see chaos Knight

1215
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,920
left in the pool as well which is

1216
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,360
another one that has seen ban after ban

1217
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,679
after ban and Primal Beast is leing true

1218
01:10:06,679 --> 01:10:08,360
to too true I didn't even notice that

1219
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,159
one I want to see Primal Beast so bad

1220
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,719
yeah yeah I'm begging them to ban CK I

1221
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:13,880
mean they probably just take it they

1222
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,080
have first pick I I'm really glad to see

1223
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,880
the Chen ban though I think a lot of

1224
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,520
teams seem to be kind of disrespecting

1225
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,600
game and I think they kind of showed

1226
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,320
early on that they're capable of this uh

1227
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,960
death ball type lineup let's go Primal

1228
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,239
woo all right but they they show that

1229
01:10:29,239 --> 01:10:30,800
they can go fast and hard and they're

1230
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,800
like super happy to just run you over

1231
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,760
and we still see teams picking like Naga

1232
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,159
first phase against them it's like you

1233
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:38,000
cannot disrespect G in this way

1234
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,440
especially when you leave the Chen in

1235
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,040
the pool even to the second phase so lgd

1236
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,760
taking that CH out I'm very happy to see

1237
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,960
it also the enchantress I think kind of

1238
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,880
does the same thing whereas they both

1239
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,199
win their Lanes they're very stable

1240
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:50,920
which leads Daio kind of gets to do his

1241
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,840
own thing and celer can help Quinn which

1242
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,000
is again kind of their bread and butter

1243
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,080
and

1244
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,640
uh they buy AAS they push Towers really

1245
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,120
fast it's kind of everything they want

1246
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,239
in one package I also like that ljd

1247
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,159
chose to let the Primal be through

1248
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,280
because I think for Ace that here is not

1249
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,480
really what he's looking for

1250
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,600
specifically because he he used to play

1251
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,239
like this long Droid Bristol back type

1252
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:13,880
of hero that are more scalable but for

1253
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,960
Primal Beast he doesn't he doesn't scale

1254
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,440
as much like in terms of like at least

1255
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,920
Tower push right like he's not he's not

1256
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,640
going to be like the hero who's going to

1257
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,920
take all the towers from the lgd so it's

1258
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,880
already like I think it's good for lgd

1259
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,120
that they don't have that pressure

1260
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,080
already starting from the first pick and

1261
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,960
I like the Chen and chant just BS for

1262
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,080
sure the nice thing with the Primal is

1263
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,920
Quinn's been practicing and playing it

1264
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,320
quite a bit in his pubs and his games so

1265
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,760
it ends up being a flex as well so you

1266
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,400
can't just end up just instant picking a

1267
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,760
carry counter pick or a mid counter pick

1268
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,199
cuz it'll go to both I would say they're

1269
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,440
valuing it more as an off laner right

1270
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,400
now just due to how kind of the map set

1271
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,400
up that the off laners get up get more

1272
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,239
Farm than the mids right now and Primal

1273
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:52,760
Beast is here that can Farm really fast

1274
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,440
with just trampling over camps and waves

1275
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,199
at the same time so it ends up just

1276
01:11:56,199 --> 01:11:58,159
becoming a stronger core in the off Lane

1277
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,280
if you get away with the lane is that

1278
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,120
every team is doing that or more gaming

1279
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,920
glad specific when you get your hands on

1280
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,159
a primal um I don't know if I can speak

1281
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:07,639
for most teams cuz some teams their off

1282
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:09,080
laners don't play Primal so it ends up

1283
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,960
just kind of being forced to Mid but for

1284
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,400
gaming I would say right now I'd expect

1285
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,400
this to be an off Lane second remain

1286
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,920
primal's like weird when it goes off

1287
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,800
Lane because it it can be punishable but

1288
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,080
there's ways to bring him back into the

1289
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,639
game like for example your fork can go

1290
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:23,840
and stack like the triangle and it's

1291
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,679
very easy for him to take Stacks with

1292
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,040
and you're for this we've seen Primal in

1293
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,480
theane abely obliterated but as as hit

1294
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,719
that bkb timing it's just his spells do

1295
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:36,719
so much damage just alone like you don't

1296
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,320
even need anything more than that bkb

1297
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,480
that that's when like games have turned

1298
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,840
around and they've made these comebacks

1299
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,600
Primal is such a hero not to be

1300
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,159
underestimated I mean it's also very

1301
01:12:45,159 --> 01:12:46,960
hard to take him down right there's not

1302
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,639
a lot of things that that could do that

1303
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:51,159
in this meta I mean I think Mo would be

1304
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:53,480
nice but it's already out of the

1305
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,400
question and uh I mean for for Primal

1306
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,239
usually pick uh they they they don't

1307
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,159
really go for big KBS nowadays they also

1308
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,000
go for different item builds like with a

1309
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,520
blade mail heart and just create

1310
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,520
chaos usually the important thing is

1311
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,159
buying uh picking a stun for the safe

1312
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:09,960
Lane you want to pick a Sven a chaos

1313
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,400
Knight are the important ones not just

1314
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,679
because they have the damage to like out

1315
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:14,960
CS the Primal but mostly because they

1316
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,120
have a stun to prevent the trample and

1317
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,199
something really interesting with the

1318
01:13:18,199 --> 01:13:19,639
Phoenix is Fenix is good in the game

1319
01:13:19,639 --> 01:13:21,040
versus Primal with the sunr is doing

1320
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,560
percent damage kind of chewing through

1321
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,520
primal's Health but in the lane the fire

1322
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,960
Spirits don't affect you you don't

1323
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,239
attack you're disarmed anyway while

1324
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:29,159
trampling so it ends up actually being a

1325
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:31,040
really comfortable Lane for Primal there

1326
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,679
I completely agree with you I think

1327
01:13:32,679 --> 01:13:34,360
something like clockwork is way better

1328
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,960
than having the things there against the

1329
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,920
Primal Primal Lane yeah purely for the

1330
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,639
lane it kind of secures you can pick a

1331
01:13:39,639 --> 01:13:42,080
range carry then uh the popular carries

1332
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,040
versus Primal either melee with stun or

1333
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:47,440
range with kite I'm sure the lgd want to

1334
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,080
B this Phenix on the off Lane with the

1335
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,480
center for now 10 seconds like at least

1336
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,679
that I I would be thinking about that I

1337
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:57,280
guess now for G if they want they have

1338
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,960
grimstroke available for them if they do

1339
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,639
want to I mean it's just good for any

1340
01:14:00,639 --> 01:14:02,560
side lane but if they do want Primal in

1341
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,840
the off Lane it's going to especially be

1342
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,320
nice there they're probably going to end

1343
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,600
up taking their carry which is really

1344
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,760
cool from the Centaur pick cuz now if

1345
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,400
gaming wants to instantly counter they

1346
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,159
can get carry counter pick for the side

1347
01:14:13,159 --> 01:14:14,800
of lgd plus the lane counter with the

1348
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,400
Primal Beast so it's kind of this weird

1349
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,719
position where if you delay your carry

1350
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,719
too long you're allowing the Centaur to

1351
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:21,280
be free in the draft and if you pick it

1352
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,040
now you open up you know Dao to get

1353
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,400
countered in the game which we've seen

1354
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,800
him counter pick with the Razer

1355
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,280
yesterday where it had a rough game and

1356
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:29,480
I was even worried that he would carry

1357
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,040
but he just ended up destroying the game

1358
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,920
with how good of a Razer it was I love

1359
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,840
this life stealer B I think it's the

1360
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,719
only two teams that are actually raiding

1361
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:40,840
this Hero at all because nobody else are

1362
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,159
really looking for that one and dich is

1363
01:14:43,159 --> 01:14:45,880
like he's known for his life stealer as

1364
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,880
well yeah we saw it yesterday in the

1365
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,600
Azure Ray Series where bom and the the

1366
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,080
strongest thing about the life steer is

1367
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,760
that he sits in his Lane for 10 to 12

1368
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,440
minutes and you can never kick him out

1369
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,960
which really hurts how gaming gliders

1370
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:57,920
wants to play they want to move their

1371
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,719
hers around take the towers really fast

1372
01:14:59,719 --> 01:15:00,560
and when there's a carrier that's

1373
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,560
sitting in the lane and you can never

1374
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,199
pressure into them it feels really bad

1375
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,760
for how you want to move around the map

1376
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,719
yeah and for gaming to to have that Hero

1377
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:08,560
on your safe Lane and not care about

1378
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,239
like how to make his gam play better and

1379
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:13,040
like have complete freedom on supports

1380
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,560
you know this is what they excel at like

1381
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,000
their two supports are usually running

1382
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,120
around mid lane and helping uh ccnc to

1383
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,760
you know do all this pressure and like

1384
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,280
start from the mid lane this is like

1385
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:26,840
what this teams really excel at

1386
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,480
the did end up getting picked up by the

1387
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,679
way sheep that was one that you were

1388
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,800
talking about it's just really powerful

1389
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,800
hero I mean you play around this inksell

1390
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,199
like Purge of the stuns it makes it so

1391
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,800
hard for anyone like you're playing with

1392
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,080
a primal already who's just going to

1393
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,600
want to go in and Destroy everyone like

1394
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,600
this Grim on top of that elevates his uh

1395
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,120
like strengths throughout all stages of

1396
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,719
the game early mid to late I think the

1397
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:51,920
hero is just to to be given so freely to

1398
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:55,400
gameing I think was 10 was rough for lgd

1399
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,719
and now they have a Sor on top of that

1400
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,840
to cover their team fight I mean looking

1401
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,600
at these three Heroes like I don't I

1402
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,800
don't really like it for gladi ear that

1403
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,040
much just purely because they're uh

1404
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,040
going away from their idea of like

1405
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,760
pressuring so much and I think it

1406
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:10,880
benefits lgd because in that game like

1407
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,800
the normal game where there's not a lot

1408
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,719
of pressure I think this is like their

1409
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,280
best chance of like taking the series

1410
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,719
down I also think so the way the draft

1411
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:22,120
kind of plays out these days is the

1412
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,400
second phase is really hard to ban

1413
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,560
Heroes as they only get get one ban for

1414
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,600
the side of lgd so they end up picking

1415
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,960
the one hero that they think is the best

1416
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,239
the lifer and they have to give up the

1417
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:32,040
griin they have to give up anything else

1418
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,520
so pretty much the only band you really

1419
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,880
get and feel confident about are the

1420
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,639
first phase and they chose to take out

1421
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:37,960
pretty much Sal Heroes they take out the

1422
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,520
Chen ench which are I think are top two

1423
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,880
right now in this tournament and so now

1424
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,159
you see him Force the S yeah as you said

1425
01:16:43,159 --> 01:16:44,600
I don't really feel too confident with

1426
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,120
this just because it's moving into

1427
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,600
they're playing into lgd's book I would

1428
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,960
say and that is something that has not

1429
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,120
really gotten them to where they are

1430
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,120
right now in the tournament and the

1431
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,920
Shadow Demon is such a great pick up to

1432
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,520
stopping this Primal Bas from doing

1433
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,760
anything in the mid game like the lane

1434
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,199
might be rough a little bit but I mean

1435
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:02,400
looking at their support right they

1436
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,040
don't have really good way of stopping

1437
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,280
him but in the mid game like against

1438
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,560
playing against Purge and the Shadow

1439
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,040
Demon as a primal base is actually

1440
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,960
impossible yeah the it's also really

1441
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,760
good for grimstroke you can Purge ink

1442
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,120
swall anytime you see a hero the Primal

1443
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,679
surprisingly it purges the charge so he

1444
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,199
can't even charge out when he get Purge

1445
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,360
exactly uh and the defensive Purge is

1446
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,679
really nice for silencer too maybe he

1447
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:23,960
can click it on the Phoenix early in the

1448
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,199
fight the Phoenix will get stuff

1449
01:17:26,199 --> 01:17:29,639
off we see the cow I mean the cow is

1450
01:17:29,639 --> 01:17:31,360
amazing here as well because those two

1451
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,679
supports they don't have really a good

1452
01:17:32,679 --> 01:17:34,679
mechanic to stop him from charging

1453
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:36,600
neither it's Primal Beast so they're

1454
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,520
going to have to think about buying ules

1455
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,880
on somebody to be able to stop his

1456
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,520
charges but it's still like we've seen

1457
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,280
so many times the Spirit Break is just

1458
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,560
like going first and the net first like

1459
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,560
even after losing his Lane horribly it

1460
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,159
doesn't matter as soon as you're buy

1461
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:51,880
like Midas and octarine you just pushing

1462
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,719
every wave and then you have this

1463
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:55,199
mechanic of like coming back to the

1464
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,320
fights from anywhere else and I think

1465
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,719
it's really important in this patch to

1466
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:00,040
have one of those Heroes that can

1467
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:01,960
connect easily to the fight and like

1468
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,800
being on the other side of the map so

1469
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,440
it's either like Spectre don't breaker

1470
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,159
or Spirit breaker that's why those

1471
01:18:07,159 --> 01:18:09,600
heroes are seeing more all right so

1472
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,800
there's some really quick stuff uh Quinn

1473
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,360
played versus Spirit breaker mid because

1474
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,600
that's what this is we see the centur so

1475
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,960
we know that this will be nothing to say

1476
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,239
hero and it was versus n pandas kotaka

1477
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:19,600
and he absolutely destroy the spirit

1478
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,480
breaker and as we talked about earlier

1479
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:22,760
Quinn's this type of player who you give

1480
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,239
him a counter pick like nek over some

1481
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:25,400
melee strength

1482
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,440
and he's going to do some work in the

1483
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,199
game I honestly was thinking that they

1484
01:18:28,199 --> 01:18:29,679
might put the Primal mid cuz that was

1485
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:31,120
the match up he played versus n pandas

1486
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,400
whereas Primal vers Spirit breaker he

1487
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,440
solo kill the lane the game ended in 20

1488
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,239
something minutes but they picked nekro

1489
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:37,639
which is if anything is a stronger Lane

1490
01:18:37,639 --> 01:18:40,080
Now versus Spirit breaker so I would be

1491
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,679
really confident now just for the fact

1492
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:42,719
that they have a hero to play around

1493
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,480
with Quinn yeah even like despite that I

1494
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,320
kind of don't like the supports on lgd I

1495
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,400
think that they're both not high on

1496
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,280
burst damage they're pretty slow I think

1497
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,800
it's much easier for G to make moves

1498
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,040
talked about how they like to kind of

1499
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,639
crush early I think now with this

1500
01:18:57,639 --> 01:18:59,520
winning mid match up I think they can

1501
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,320
make much more plays or they can even

1502
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,040
just kind of play it chill and wait for

1503
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,440
their timings on Primal or whoever and

1504
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,560
just make sure that they're playing

1505
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,040
defensively where they use Global to

1506
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,679
cover any ganks that lgd try and make

1507
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:11,639
yeah it seems like they don't really

1508
01:19:11,639 --> 01:19:13,159
think about like going to the mid game

1509
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:15,080
and like how necros might be bit against

1510
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,159
porge and like not you know like not

1511
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:19,360
being that tanky core but at the same

1512
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,760
time like they're just looking purely on

1513
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,639
L and they're like this NE is going to

1514
01:19:22,639 --> 01:19:24,440
Stomp the spear break so hard that they

1515
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,600
going to like like you know completely

1516
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,520
run them over but I'm still worried

1517
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,600
because usually their lineups they have

1518
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,199
this good Tower damage and this is how

1519
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,560
they were able to uh close the games up

1520
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,520
so fast but on this lineup specifically

1521
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,400
there's no like hero that you know kills

1522
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,520
Tower so they need to find some uh

1523
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,320
material like Tero blade or something

1524
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,159
from Dasia side that actually like helps

1525
01:19:43,159 --> 01:19:45,920
them take down objectives in this game a

1526
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,360
lot of their success with the Decker

1527
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,400
ends up pairing it with other push or

1528
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,120
other healing they picked it with Dazzle

1529
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,040
offlane in the past where they both just

1530
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,040
ball up and they go just end the game

1531
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,520
and they probably picked it with tides

1532
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,040
and Chens so they don't really have the

1533
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,320
draft that you win 20 minutes and you

1534
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,080
walk down the lane yet we'll see what

1535
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,880
Dau ends up picking but I would say it's

1536
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,080
outside of teror Blade that's not really

1537
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,760
his heroo he doesn't really pick the

1538
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,280
early

1539
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,199
game

1540
01:20:10,199 --> 01:20:12,639
Alchemist that's one way to up the to me

1541
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,880
this game looks like the game one

1542
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,000
against liquid where they chose to go

1543
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
for you know regular lineup and it

1544
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,320
didn't really work for them and they

1545
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,560
lost that game to to liquid so I think

1546
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:26,400
that like to me it at at least that this

1547
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,920
is the game for lgd if they manage to

1548
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,840
like get out from the lanes evenly or

1549
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,280
like not super stomped and uh you know

1550
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,600
going to the mid game I think they have

1551
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:37,639
way better chances I want to trust this

1552
01:20:37,639 --> 01:20:39,480
uh spear breaker I think spear breaker

1553
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:40,960
is a crazy hero but I'm too worried

1554
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,199
about the mid match up going in the way

1555
01:20:42,199 --> 01:20:44,560
for gaming Gladiators so I think that

1556
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,880
Quinn will just Stomp the mid lane and

1557
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,159
just carry the momentum throughout the

1558
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:48,840
whole game do you think even if uh the

1559
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,960
spirit Burger does get shut down in Lane

1560
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,360
he's still going to have that disruption

1561
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,719
in team fights and will still have an

1562
01:20:53,719 --> 01:20:55,360
impact that could car Mar a later game

1563
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,440
for lgd if there's one hero I would want

1564
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:01,040
to get crushed on Mid Spirit Break so he

1565
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,880
has that going for him that that one

1566
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,920
small glimmer of hope yeah I agree with

1567
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,960
you guys although that being said I I

1568
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,960
really like game's speed that they can

1569
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,560
pull up here I think like when Alchemist

1570
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,760
gets his blink dagger and they're able

1571
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,120
to kind of move around the map and be

1572
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,760
really fast about it I think lgd are

1573
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,679
going to struggle playing into this

1574
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:19,679
Global uh anything else you guys want to

1575
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:21,080
talk about very quickly especially this

1576
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,199
act we've seen it a couple times for Dao

1577
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:24,440
is it going to be that thing that ties

1578
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,239
up all together the make a break for

1579
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,600
gaming gladies quickly Gana uh yeah I

1580
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,080
think the Alchemist Lane is going to be

1581
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,000
really stable top and he'll have a

1582
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,400
really good time and just they have so

1583
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,199
much time to make space for him just

1584
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,840
bodies on the map and pressure that

1585
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:37,920
he'll have a good time forarm his

1586
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,719
Radiance all right I like it let's see

1587
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:41,800
how much confidence uh gaming Gladiator

1588
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,760
coach has in their

1589
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,480
draft thank you very much I am standing

1590
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:51,000
by with Cy of a gaming Gladiators who uh

1591
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,199
you had a late last late night last

1592
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,159
night my man how much which time did you

1593
01:21:55,159 --> 01:21:57,320
have to prepare for today as a whole did

1594
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,639
you only get to prepare for lgd or did

1595
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:02,719
you prepare for lgd and spirit we only

1596
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,320
prepared for lgd we didn't have that

1597
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,520
much time as well I also want to get

1598
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,360
some sleep it's pretty important but one

1599
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,239
game at a time you know so no

1600
01:22:09,239 --> 01:22:11,800
preparation for Spirit one game at a

1601
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,600
time and you come up with a silencer

1602
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,239
what's this guy doing in this draft for

1603
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:19,920
you guys hopefully silenc is

1604
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,560
Phoenix I never knew DOTA was just that

1605
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,199
simple now you only got to prepare for

1606
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,800
lgd but I remember that during the ri

1607
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,320
Masters you and I got quite a few

1608
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,520
opportunities to interact and you seemed

1609
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,760
confident in your lower bracket run it

1610
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,320
unfortunately got cut short at Fourth

1611
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,280
Place why should I believe you this time

1612
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,760
that you're going to make it all the way

1613
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,040
I mean this time we already made it to

1614
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,840
third right so it's better than last

1615
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,760
time so you should just

1616
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:48,760
believe se you ready to watch some

1617
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:52,239
DOTA let's get lower bracket finals

1618
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:54,679
started let's indeed here we go ladies

1619
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:56,760
and gentlemen lgz up against gaming

1620
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,040
Gladiators to start off this final day

1621
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,400
of the international fog we heard there

1622
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,800
from c y coming in with a bit of a

1623
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,960
different pick this game on gaming

1624
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,199
Gladiators side the silencer could this

1625
01:23:06,199 --> 01:23:07,840
be the answer to the Phoenix a hero that

1626
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,679
we're seeing time and time again so far

1627
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:11,000
this tournament definitely feels like a

1628
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,400
kind of cool pick a very different one

1629
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,000
style here very good versus the Phoenix

1630
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,639
but also versus these saves that we've

1631
01:23:15,639 --> 01:23:17,040
been seeing a lot coming out in this

1632
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,239
tournament the Shadow Demon in

1633
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:20,080
particular we've seen so many games

1634
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,600
where people just get bailed out of

1635
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,400
certain death very difficult if you're

1636
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,520
globaled so we'll have to itemization

1637
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,639
and stuff of course there's going to be

1638
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:28,320
some demonic cleanses that you can

1639
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,040
pre-cast and stuff like that we'll get

1640
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,880
all into that as we do have an early

1641
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,840
smoke from lgd let's see if they can get

1642
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,199
the catch here coming in with the

1643
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:37,280
wraparound trying to enter into gaming

1644
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,159
Gladiators jungle but gaming Gladiators

1645
01:23:39,159 --> 01:23:40,320
they're hovering around that mid tier

1646
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,320
one Tower and a bit of a tough point at

1647
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,560
the map for lgd to

1648
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,600
strike very unlikely somebody gets

1649
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,320
caught out here gaming very prep super

1650
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,719
prepared yeah they know this sort of

1651
01:23:49,719 --> 01:23:51,520
play is going to be coming out here I'm

1652
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,600
looking forward to this one this looks

1653
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,000
like it should be a pretty fight heavy

1654
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,159
I say thater they kind of Step across

1655
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,159
set up with A disruption you looking for

1656
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:02,760
the follow contion there hold him back

1657
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,400
doesn't matter you still fight The Who

1658
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,400
on to celery celer taken down first BL

1659
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,239
Ford if they can find something in

1660
01:24:09,239 --> 01:24:10,840
return G me Gladiators the curse upon

1661
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,760
you they will at least get the trade

1662
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,560
Quinn not able to get the first blood

1663
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,080
but still getting that kill as the mid

1664
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,280
lane is going to feel pretty good for

1665
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,280
him as the necros especially versus that

1666
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,719
Spirit breaker in particular too this is

1667
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,760
a match up that Quinn could snowball out

1668
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,080
of control just like panel was talking

1669
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,280
about Planet messing with Thea quite a

1670
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:27,719
bit here he's going to try and make it a

1671
01:24:27,719 --> 01:24:29,239
little bit more more Awkward for him on

1672
01:24:29,239 --> 01:24:31,159
his way back towards that Top Lane extra

1673
01:24:31,159 --> 01:24:32,960
bit of damage coming in and he'll

1674
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,239
certainly have money to play with as he

1675
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:35,679
was the one indeed to get that first

1676
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:38,120
Blood lgd Planet not hesitating

1677
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,600
whatsoever instantly buys out pretty

1678
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,199
much everything I think triple mangoes

1679
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:42,480
purchased up so he's looking to be

1680
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,199
pretty aggressive up here a pretty

1681
01:24:44,199 --> 01:24:45,280
strong Lane I don't think that we've

1682
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,600
seen too much anymore I know the Centaur

1683
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,760
a ton but Centaur and Shadow Demon an

1684
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,639
old classic very aggressive a lot of

1685
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:53,920
damage if these two start to get a bit

1686
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,440
of a level Advantage this Alchemist and

1687
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:57,840
silencer could end up being very

1688
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,320
vulnerable against the huge amounts of

1689
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,719
burst that these two can come out within

1690
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:02,560
the landing stage gaming Gladiators they

1691
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:03,880
got to be careful up there yeah

1692
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,239
absolutely this is probably the lane

1693
01:25:05,239 --> 01:25:06,639
where lots of chaos is going to be

1694
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:08,400
happening mid lane I think we already

1695
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,880
kind of expect the Quinn should be able

1696
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,440
to take advantage of this one massively

1697
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,239
versus nothing to say bottom Lane all

1698
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:15,760
this one could also be pretty kill heavy

1699
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,960
as well too especially for the side of

1700
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,400
gaming already in underneath the tower

1701
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,440
shirro in trouble one more slap from Ace

1702
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,880
will get the job done Shiro taken down

1703
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,119
Ace will lose his life but happily

1704
01:25:26,119 --> 01:25:27,560
taking that trade they're getting in and

1705
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,480
taking the carry out all this is going

1706
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:32,719
to be bloodthirsty in these side

1707
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,360
Lanes overall as well what you sort of

1708
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,080
take away from the the carry decisions

1709
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,679
from both teams cuz it was quite a quick

1710
01:25:38,679 --> 01:25:40,560
pick with the Luna in response of The

1711
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,239
Alchemist coming out at the end from uh

1712
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:44,000
from gaming Gladiators do you feel this

1713
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,119
was what lgd were going for for anyway

1714
01:25:46,119 --> 01:25:47,480
or do you think this was directly

1715
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,440
because of the AL being picked I think

1716
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,280
it probably could have been something

1717
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,480
they were looking for anyway because of

1718
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,440
the necros I know shirro he's one of the

1719
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,040
few players that I seen that's actually

1720
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,080
still doing this like 311 build even in

1721
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,719
the early game he's very aggressive

1722
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:00,440
likes him be involved early on so maybe

1723
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,440
it's that mixed magical physical damage

1724
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,040
they wanted just be able to have versus

1725
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,000
the necro as well too and it fits for

1726
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,840
kind of this early Style with the Shadow

1727
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,880
Demon that can look to brawl and fight

1728
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:12,000
often they probably a couple mixtures of

1729
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,320
things that they did want it want with

1730
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,679
it also is going to be very good for

1731
01:26:14,679 --> 01:26:16,639
this night vision of course too playing

1732
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:17,920
with the spirit breaker playing with

1733
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,560
this Luna night vision can be pretty

1734
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,080
strong inside of these team fights

1735
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:25,159
so so far looking at the last hit that's

1736
01:26:25,159 --> 01:26:27,360
the mid lane as you say as expected the

1737
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,159
edge here for Quinn but look at Ace's

1738
01:26:29,159 --> 01:26:30,920
last hits right now bottom does get that

1739
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,400
kill early on of course but he's only

1740
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,119
got three to his name versus Shiro at

1741
01:26:34,119 --> 01:26:36,239
the

1742
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,159
moment getting to the point already

1743
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:39,280
where you know it's not easy for nothing

1744
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,560
to say to sort of approach this midwave

1745
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:43,119
as able to take huge amounts of damage

1746
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:45,600
and favorable trade going the way of of

1747
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,040
it's Quinn necros in this one V one Top

1748
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,320
Lane Daio he's in a bit of trouble he's

1749
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,159
got the concoction cooking up is he able

1750
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:54,239
to throw it out he he holds it for the

1751
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:56,480
the deny all right all right that'll

1752
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,719
that'll get the job done he's out of

1753
01:26:57,719 --> 01:26:59,199
Lane for a few seconds but at least able

1754
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:00,840
to stop lgd from getting the kill

1755
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,679
against him but he is really struggling

1756
01:27:02,679 --> 01:27:04,600
on the last hit department so far new

1757
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,040
and planted bringing it to him I knew

1758
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,920
didn't win yesterday but made some

1759
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,920
pretty amazing plays on and look at this

1760
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,440
in the mid lane it's getting pretty

1761
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,560
nasty Quinn just sort of running nothing

1762
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,199
to say right back underneath the tier

1763
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:18,360
two I mean what do you do at this point

1764
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,040
in this one V one at the least he can go

1765
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,080
back and he can just charge out and

1766
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,400
stuff right so he can make moves all

1767
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,239
over the match but it's a match up that

1768
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,000
knows he's going to inevitably lose but

1769
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,400
it is at least a hero that can make

1770
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,920
moves around and is probably one of the

1771
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,320
best recovery heroes in the game at the

1772
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,800
moment so for sure and for gaming

1773
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,239
Gladiators they need Quinn to be having

1774
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:35,400
this sort of start in the mid because as

1775
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,239
we're seeing on the side Lanes it's not

1776
01:27:37,239 --> 01:27:38,800
going quite as well for them yeah they

1777
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:39,920
need somebody to build a rally around

1778
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,239
especially The Alchemist is having this

1779
01:27:41,239 --> 01:27:43,639
slow of a start for Daio nice attempt

1780
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:44,719
there from planet Trying to Catch the

1781
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:47,719
Wave unable

1782
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:52,639
to level three another big kill threat

1783
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:53,560
that they're going to be able to have up

1784
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,159
here on the side of lgd bottom though

1785
01:27:55,159 --> 01:27:57,080
Ace Contin to get aggressive and they've

1786
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,480
got the inks well stun it'll allow them

1787
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,239
to set up to take down while you smile

1788
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:01,480
Gladiators whil they might not be

1789
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:02,920
getting the easiest to farm here for

1790
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,800
race down bottom they're finding action

1791
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,119
Top Lane Dao it's going to fall pretty

1792
01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:10,159
low here to the poisons won't quite die

1793
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:12,360
both new and Planet also getting beaten

1794
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,520
down pretty low by zeler if he gets

1795
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,480
another one could be a kill as he's

1796
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,719
cooking up a concoction one more if

1797
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:19,800
anything he's just going to allow planet

1798
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,520
to try and find further connections but

1799
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,719
the force there turn toward C in deu

1800
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:25,960
he's stepping up he's got a hoop Stomp

1801
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,760
and a double H celery he could be in a

1802
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,159
lot of trouble andu will go with the

1803
01:28:29,159 --> 01:28:31,239
right clicks alone and takes celery down

1804
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:32,560
backs away Mak sure not to use the

1805
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,600
Double H to bring himself too low back

1806
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,320
in nothing to say with the rotation

1807
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,440
charges forward on towards Dao Dao this

1808
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,159
time will not be able to deny himself

1809
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:43,119
Planet gets the kill I mean these two

1810
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:44,960
honestly planed and knew yesterday were

1811
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,840
making magic happen again putting a ton

1812
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,679
of pressure up here the silencers trying

1813
01:28:48,679 --> 01:28:50,000
to dissuade the pressure of course with

1814
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,600
those Arcane curses but they're just

1815
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,320
waiting patient and as you said there

1816
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,600
they understand use the double edge go

1817
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,920
for the right clicks very very

1818
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:59,119
calculating in particular really knowing

1819
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:00,560
his limits on this hero playing

1820
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,600
aggressively despite his HP being

1821
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,520
incredibly low in these situations and

1822
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:05,679
there you see right away it's like yeah

1823
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:07,159
he's losing the mid lane on the spirit

1824
01:29:07,159 --> 01:29:09,000
breaker but I think Spirit breaker

1825
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,239
Primal Beast probably two of the best

1826
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:11,679
heroes that can just easily make those

1827
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,800
rotations get some good connection but

1828
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:14,960
yeah Quinn he definitely will be an

1829
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,119
issue that they're going to have to find

1830
01:29:16,119 --> 01:29:17,560
some answers and they do have answers to

1831
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,119
say this game progresses they've got the

1832
01:29:19,119 --> 01:29:20,280
Demonic Purge it's always going to be

1833
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,480
able to remove the ghost Tru they've got

1834
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,159
this massive amount of magic damage that

1835
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:24,600
comes from Phoenix and potentially from

1836
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,480
the Luna he's not going for the beam

1837
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,239
build just yet but of course he'll have

1838
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:30,920
those points in later so overall for for

1839
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,719
lgd the fact that they know that Quinn's

1840
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:34,600
getting this completely uninterrupted

1841
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:35,920
free Farm in the mid lane you don't

1842
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,520
think they're too concerned about that

1843
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,520
no I don't think so I mean there's going

1844
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,760
to be of course a lot of plays that

1845
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:40,800
happen with these you know Global

1846
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,600
silences that can just potentially save

1847
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,880
Quinn versus a lot of the burst and

1848
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:45,400
whatnot but they probably feel like they

1849
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:46,760
do have some answers since they have

1850
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,440
that mixed magic nothing to say shows in

1851
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,520
the mid that's deep they cff the wave U

1852
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:51,480
not quite able to connect with the

1853
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,560
initial slow see Quinn should be able to

1854
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:54,960
close in with the the inell buff upon

1855
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,639
him he's got the sight ready to drop

1856
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:57,880
down if he feels that the kill is going

1857
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,600
to be there he'll drop it and he's got

1858
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,600
it quid able to take down nothing to say

1859
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,679
10 time up top though dra and a spoted

1860
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:05,800
bother being chased out by lgd

1861
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,360
completely surrounded by the three of

1862
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,000
them disruption is there to try and mess

1863
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,159
up the ability for him to throw

1864
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:11,840
concoction will sell stun and call for

1865
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,800
stun to hit onto new but it won't save

1866
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,400
Dao as he goes down once again planed

1867
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,880
actually even holding the poisons I

1868
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,320
think maybe just saving that kill there

1869
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,600
for a new some calculation coming in 5

1870
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,679
to four action packed early game

1871
01:30:24,679 --> 01:30:26,280
I this Top Lane he's sort of been what

1872
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,639
knocked out of this Top Lane three times

1873
01:30:27,639 --> 01:30:29,600
already Dao it's not getting any easier

1874
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,159
for him up here he's got pretty much

1875
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:32,800
nothing right now I mean 2400 gold so

1876
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,520
he's similar as that Spirit breaker but

1877
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,920
level three only on The Alchemist so

1878
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:39,239
far and soon to be hitting what level

1879
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:41,320
five on you y massive amounts of bur

1880
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:42,560
going to be coming in they've got this

1881
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,239
decently sized creep wave pushing

1882
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:46,880
forward in towards them as well so lgd

1883
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,880
in a very happy spot in this Top Lane in

1884
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,040
particular yeah they're starting to

1885
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,639
leave Ace alone down bottom tofu is

1886
01:30:51,639 --> 01:30:53,719
trying to rectify what's going on up top

1887
01:30:53,719 --> 01:30:55,719
trying help out Daio yeah they hit it

1888
01:30:55,719 --> 01:30:57,960
with the scan though lgd so he'll be

1889
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,880
knowing to say stay safe to close to the

1890
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,760
tower he's unlikely to be caught out by

1891
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,560
this

1892
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,880
rotation nice attempt there by y Ace

1893
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,880
maybe going to force a dive

1894
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,280
here oh he actually stops it as well too

1895
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:13,800
very well played but at the same time

1896
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,159
why you smile he's down to the low

1897
01:31:15,159 --> 01:31:17,159
ground with the Sunray that was so quick

1898
01:31:17,159 --> 01:31:18,800
the Sunray but can he get away I don't

1899
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,000
know if he can he's going to have a few

1900
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,040
spirits to throw down onto Ace loen beam

1901
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:24,080
as well trying to hold Ace back he's

1902
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,360
going to continue to run this down

1903
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,040
another SP slowing down the attack speed

1904
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,880
it's enough to actually allow why SM to

1905
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,360
get away meanwhile back on the top side

1906
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:33,119
of the M Dao got taken down once again

1907
01:31:33,119 --> 01:31:34,679
this time Quinn turns up wants to try

1908
01:31:34,679 --> 01:31:36,719
and make lgd pay for it they will get

1909
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:38,280
Nur return but they won't get nothing to

1910
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:41,400
say just another instance now where Dao

1911
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,159
he is not having fun up here he

1912
01:31:43,159 --> 01:31:44,679
certainly isn't butu does have to be a

1913
01:31:44,679 --> 01:31:45,760
little cautious the one thing about

1914
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,080
Centaur playing versus silencer don't

1915
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:49,119
want to die too much giving up that in

1916
01:31:49,119 --> 01:31:50,679
can be a problem for the

1917
01:31:50,679 --> 01:31:53,400
hers with the burst it's another SC kill

1918
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,520
here for win this necro I think that's

1919
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,040
what boots travel finished up so his

1920
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,239
movement around the map is going to get

1921
01:31:59,239 --> 01:32:00,760
faster and faster now looking to

1922
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,920
pressure I mean he's going to get good

1923
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,440
damage on this Tower here good thing

1924
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,800
that y's there to at least drag a little

1925
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,880
bit but Quin just starts chasing he's in

1926
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,040
under the tower celery he's getting do

1927
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,600
by the two of them I don't think

1928
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,119
there'll be any TP backup for this poor

1929
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:15,000
old silence C he coming in now but

1930
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,080
celery will still fall Planet finishes

1931
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,840
off the kill question is if gaming

1932
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,639
Gladiators can find some in return drao

1933
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:22,000
is able to step in throw down the

1934
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,320
concoction these are Big kills for

1935
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:26,199
gladiators to be picking up same time

1936
01:32:26,199 --> 01:32:28,760
down bottom Ace chased upon by nothing

1937
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,639
to say and Shir the ulate up in a second

1938
01:32:31,639 --> 01:32:33,080
here for the spirit breaker but he can't

1939
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,000
quite find the vision nothing to say so

1940
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,199
Ace he'll walk out alive once more a

1941
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:38,600
good attempt but just a bit too tanky

1942
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,960
see that he actually did put at least

1943
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,520
two points in the loosen beam most of

1944
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,560
these players haven't going for like the

1945
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,080
113 build not able to get the kill but a

1946
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:48,000
good attempt top three cores on the side

1947
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,840
of gaming gladers even though Dao is

1948
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,880
dying a lot up top he's still doing

1949
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:53,280
pretty decent all things consider

1950
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,440
espcially with the fact those kind of

1951
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,960
last few deaths on New on that Top Lane

1952
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,800
definitely swinging things back in favor

1953
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,560
of gaming Gladiators and now can they

1954
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:01,760
hold on to this mid Tower is the

1955
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,840
question surrounded another easy kill

1956
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,520
here for Quinn to get involved and now

1957
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,560
dominating on the necros and he knows

1958
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:09,840
immediately the Shadow Demon was getting

1959
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,000
those Stacks up we'll be able to take

1960
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,480
them away instantly aggressive posturing

1961
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,239
by Gaming Gladiators again playing

1962
01:33:15,239 --> 01:33:17,560
around Quinn with this strong start yeah

1963
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,600
they can play aggressively around him on

1964
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,360
this mid area of the map and at the same

1965
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,960
time if lgd look for any moves now the

1966
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:25,719
Sid Lanes with the boots to travel Quinn

1967
01:33:25,719 --> 01:33:27,320
he's likely to be there every single

1968
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:29,080
time so whilst lgd got away with those

1969
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:32,119
early kills the whole the the difficulty

1970
01:33:32,119 --> 01:33:33,760
it stepped up massively making the moves

1971
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,719
for lgd it's no longer easy no and

1972
01:33:35,719 --> 01:33:37,400
nobody wants to go mid right they have W

1973
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:38,800
smile here just trying to slow down the

1974
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,480
push just thr fire spirits on the wave

1975
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,199
but the tower inevitably dropping very

1976
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:44,480
soon Quinn very active a smoke moving

1977
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,239
toward top new he shows himself yeah

1978
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:48,040
sc's back up he's ready to look for

1979
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,400
another

1980
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,600
stack see if new able to play as well

1981
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,560
the looks of it sort of avoided one

1982
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,440
another you will be able to get around

1983
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,679
from this one they'll hit him with the

1984
01:33:58,679 --> 01:34:00,440
scam but he's already back to the safety

1985
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:02,080
of his side of the map so you nicely

1986
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,480
avoiding that move there it's actually

1987
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:05,199
both scans they used immediately both of

1988
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:06,480
them trying to find him so he's able to

1989
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,639
sneak himself away from that at the

1990
01:34:07,639 --> 01:34:09,960
least Ace will be able to clean up some

1991
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,280
jungle is going down the blade Mail

1992
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,320
Route pretty good blade mail game versus

1993
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:16,000
this Luna versus the Phoenix across the

1994
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,159
board and very early aggressive words

1995
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:19,320
that we're seeing gaming already placing

1996
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,280
down so they're going to have good

1997
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,760
information when you're playing versus

1998
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,239
something like Spirit breaker if he has

1999
01:34:23,239 --> 01:34:24,440
such a hard Lane you know he doesn't

2000
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:26,000
want to return back mid when they get

2001
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,159
these deep Wards down you're going to

2002
01:34:27,159 --> 01:34:28,560
see these charges coming through so

2003
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:29,520
they're they're going to have a lot of

2004
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:30,840
information to play off in these next

2005
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,400
few moments me what do lgd do for the

2006
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:34,440
next move they're going to try and go on

2007
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:35,880
bottom but the global silence comes out

2008
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:38,119
for he's ready to turn goes back in with

2009
01:34:38,119 --> 01:34:40,080
the ultimate straight onir the sight

2010
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,760
there they've got the burst Quinn turns

2011
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,360
up takes him

2012
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,639
down as at this point of the game it

2013
01:34:45,639 --> 01:34:48,000
feels just so incredibly difficult for

2014
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,040
lgd to make any sort of moves but at the

2015
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:51,119
same time they don't want to sit back

2016
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:52,719
and farm because on the other side of

2017
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:54,119
the map there's an alchem is picking

2018
01:34:54,119 --> 01:34:56,320
things up I it's still a bold attempt to

2019
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,960
go for this P he is very tanky 1400 HP

2020
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,639
already they are quite lacking in the

2021
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:03,040
damage early game's bottom Tower is

2022
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:05,000
under attack quick rotation this Tower

2023
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,360
going to get pressured massively here

2024
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:07,280
they will be able to hold on to their

2025
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,360
mid Tower at the least and get some

2026
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,480
levels on the Phoenix but damage being

2027
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,840
done here from gaming gladers early on

2028
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,960
they're opening it up for Dao to get

2029
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,639
good timing even though he's got four

2030
01:35:15,639 --> 01:35:16,880
deaths he's about to have his sacred

2031
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,560
Relic already done it really seems like

2032
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,719
it didn't matter catching up

2033
01:35:21,719 --> 01:35:24,920
massively lgd where they go

2034
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:27,760
next and difficult for Luna as well too

2035
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,560
if you do start struggling in this game

2036
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:31,199
the Heroes that you have to run you down

2037
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:32,440
there's a primal Beast there's this

2038
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:34,000
necro who's going to be immensely tanky

2039
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,320
and a Radiance that's going to come out

2040
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,199
soon lgd need to start getting something

2041
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,040
going in their favor got the get the top

2042
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,520
t one but TPS are coming in from gaming

2043
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,440
Gladiators see if they're able to catch

2044
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,320
anything Quinn not quite able to get in

2045
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:48,600
reach of new with the ink SW as L they

2046
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:49,840
get the objective and they won't lose

2047
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,320
anything for it I look where nothing to

2048
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,080
say is being forced to try to find Farm

2049
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,960
he's just on the outskirts try trying to

2050
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,480
get anything it looks like it was

2051
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:57,440
scouted out though I mean they were

2052
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,239
pinging it yeah seler he seems to know

2053
01:35:59,239 --> 01:36:01,320
something's

2054
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,840
up and that's sort of one way to to get

2055
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,639
back in the game as a mid Spirit breaker

2056
01:36:05,639 --> 01:36:07,199
it's just not easy looking for kills

2057
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:09,840
looking for action it's not lgd strong

2058
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,280
point right now against the tools that

2059
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,239
gaming Gladiators have managed to amass

2060
01:36:13,239 --> 01:36:14,600
no and overall too he's he's playing

2061
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:15,760
into the Primal Beast which is a hero

2062
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,000
that just doesn't even care about status

2063
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,080
resist if he gets the grab onto the

2064
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,880
again trouble trouble the Luci be just

2065
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:24,119
in time to hold Ace back and he's able

2066
01:36:24,119 --> 01:36:26,080
to get out of the range of the ink swell

2067
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,719
on by now under of the two supports

2068
01:36:27,719 --> 01:36:29,199
gaming Gladiators they continue to move

2069
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:31,040
forward they've got the burst they dro

2070
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,600
the side not quite enough damage to

2071
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:36,280
burst pops the egg they can't quite take

2072
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:38,040
it out queler they try to hit it but

2073
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,040
they can't stop the Supernova it's a

2074
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:42,000
Turn Around from lgd they're taking out

2075
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,920
tofu they're taking out celery they'll

2076
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,639
bring Quinn lowo can lgd get more out of

2077
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:48,159
this both Ace and Quinn incredibly low

2078
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:49,440
at the side of the fight Direct on the

2079
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,440
retreat nothing to say charges in over

2080
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:54,199
for WS Quinn who stop from you as well

2081
01:36:54,199 --> 01:36:57,280
they've got the they take down a for lgd

2082
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,960
Strike Back hard beautiful connection

2083
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,280
what an egg right in the middle of

2084
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,480
everybody gaming tried to go for a very

2085
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,360
early aggressive play here the reaper

2086
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,239
doesn't do much damage at all oh they

2087
01:37:07,239 --> 01:37:09,320
needed that they needed that big time an

2088
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:12,159
amazing fight there for lgd big Wombo

2089
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:13,920
Combo team fight abilities connecting

2090
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:15,480
perfectly

2091
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,880
there we'll see the the move again you

2092
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,400
know gaming Gladiators they walk right

2093
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:20,840
into this I mean it looked like a solid

2094
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,800
start going for Shir but between the

2095
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,760
Stampede the they hold back at the loen

2096
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:26,520
beam avoiding that initial attempt from

2097
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,320
Ace they feel good at they get the soul

2098
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,920
bind it's an early s but it's one that

2099
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,679
you feel tempted to go for cuz they link

2100
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,639
together but it's just a bit too soon

2101
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:35,199
the burst isn't there and at this point

2102
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:36,520
I think you got the fire Spirits out as

2103
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,440
well the hon are new they just didn't

2104
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:40,320
allow gaming Gladiators any chance to

2105
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,040
take down this egg I honestly like

2106
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:43,639
pretty beautiful spell casting coming

2107
01:37:43,639 --> 01:37:44,920
out across the board Planet even with

2108
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,480
that little disruption buying time so

2109
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,800
that they both don't get grabbed from

2110
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,159
the Primal Beast they're going to try

2111
01:37:49,159 --> 01:37:50,760
and go again here gaming Gladiators this

2112
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:53,000
time they might find Shiro they're in on

2113
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,440
top of him zin's back up the grabs there

2114
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,280
shirro won't survive this time around

2115
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,360
gaming ladat is not to be deterred after

2116
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:01,080
that the way that that last fight went

2117
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:02,719
they went straight back here this time

2118
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:04,679
they get the job done no hesitation they

2119
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:05,880
know that they are pretty cool down Rel

2120
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,000
line to be able to turn those fights

2121
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,119
early game since they do have that

2122
01:38:08,119 --> 01:38:09,719
little bit of a lead they do have Global

2123
01:38:09,719 --> 01:38:11,360
as well too that last fight celery

2124
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:12,800
didn't have it so hanging on to it for

2125
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,159
the next upcoming fights to clean up

2126
01:38:15,159 --> 01:38:17,560
these ancients Radiance it is

2127
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:20,560
finished

2128
01:38:20,679 --> 01:38:23,000
ranning seeing if Y is going to commit

2129
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,760
for this here he has The Shard queued up

2130
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:26,360
very early on this Phoenix I was

2131
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:27,760
expecting to maybe see that Midas queued

2132
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,280
up but we'll have to see which route he

2133
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:32,199
wants to be able to go on this

2134
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:37,280
Phoenix think to calm down a little bit

2135
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,800
here from gaming Gladiators definitely

2136
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,040
going to be a bit more careful about how

2137
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,840
they make that next move yeah I think if

2138
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:42,760
they're going to make that next move

2139
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:44,560
they're likely to have the global in

2140
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,920
particular hesitate a little bit more

2141
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,080
with how far they go for the big

2142
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:51,760
dive but lgd feeling more confident here

2143
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,000
looking for Quinn as well too comes

2144
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,760
out they will manage to walk this off so

2145
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,840
not the worst of situations there for LG

2146
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,080
they'll feel quite good about that one

2147
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:01,239
baiting the global gives them a good few

2148
01:39:01,239 --> 01:39:02,920
minute or so to make that next play

2149
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:04,599
without the threat of celer being able

2150
01:39:04,599 --> 01:39:05,920
to put a stop to their moov so a

2151
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,880
successful bait of the ultimate from lgd

2152
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:09,239
yeah good trade demonic Pur only has

2153
01:39:09,239 --> 01:39:10,679
like a 60sec cool down so that's going

2154
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:11,840
to be coming up pretty soon again if

2155
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:12,880
they want to make that aggressive move

2156
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,599
on the Quinn it's always going to be a

2157
01:39:14,599 --> 01:39:15,760
pretty good kill threat just being able

2158
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,000
to get make sure he can't ever get Ghost

2159
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,800
round off get the focus fire so he can't

2160
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,800
move but every minute that anything

2161
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,639
slows down the G the gold Le just

2162
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:24,400
massively goes for Gladiators in seconds

2163
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,679
L they've got to try and abuse this

2164
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,520
window the the global silence being

2165
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,520
unavailable for gaming Gladiators can

2166
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,320
they find Quinn can they pop

2167
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:34,360
him Al at ready it's underneath this

2168
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:36,239
Ward setup from gaming Gladiators not an

2169
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:38,199
easy part for for lgd to strike into

2170
01:39:38,199 --> 01:39:39,760
whilst they lack the vision on The High

2171
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,760
Ground Ace giving a lot of information

2172
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:44,760
as well for gladiators their front line

2173
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,840
is just so tanky here all three

2174
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:49,560
effectively are pretty pretty tank in

2175
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:50,719
the side of gaming Quinn almost has his

2176
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:54,239
heart finished up

2177
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,599
I was waiting to see if tofu is actually

2178
01:39:55,599 --> 01:39:57,239
queuing up his bit of a different route

2179
01:39:57,239 --> 01:39:58,719
of items he's actually going for the

2180
01:39:58,719 --> 01:39:59,920
ules I mean playing versus the spirit

2181
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,239
breaker it's pretty common to see it but

2182
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:03,760
I mean I think we've pretty much always

2183
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,239
seen those Grims go for those Shard

2184
01:40:05,239 --> 01:40:07,480
right away just how effective it can

2185
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:09,599
be but I guess maybe because of the

2186
01:40:09,599 --> 01:40:11,840
Shadow Demon he is hesitating for it a

2187
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,119
little bit just cuz that demonic Purge

2188
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:14,320
but we'll have to

2189
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,239
seees going to have Quinn on the front

2190
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:17,440
line she's going to get caught in the

2191
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:18,760
com for nothing to say but he's still

2192
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:20,760
got H to play they jump forward with the

2193
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,520
S B there response Quin he's per with

2194
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:24,960
the side down on the two of them takes

2195
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,639
nothing to say out us to fall from the

2196
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:28,560
curse damage of celery the egg

2197
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,599
successful but there's no chance for lgd

2198
01:40:30,599 --> 01:40:32,400
to fight aggressively off the back of it

2199
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,679
why is has to TP out of the fight I mean

2200
01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:36,199
your two tanky front liners just get

2201
01:40:36,199 --> 01:40:37,400
detonated right at the start of the

2202
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,320
fight egg connects but doesn't really do

2203
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:42,080
much of anything tower now looks like

2204
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,719
gaming still want to go for even more

2205
01:40:43,719 --> 01:40:47,119
kills as well too Dao full

2206
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:49,520
bkb now he feels pretty unkillable with

2207
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,480
this bkb on The Alchemist now I mean

2208
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,360
mostly magic damage on their draft early

2209
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,719
game here for lgd this is just going to

2210
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:57,880
make Dao pretty

2211
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:59,920
invincible and yeah Quinn looks like he

2212
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,320
does go for that Shard before finishing

2213
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:02,400
up the heart so he's got a bit more

2214
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,480
Mobility versus The Shadow Demon as well

2215
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:05,800
and they are controlling a lot of this

2216
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,239
map I mean they're denying a lot of farm

2217
01:41:07,239 --> 01:41:10,080
away from lgd from shirro in

2218
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,040
particular I think the concern as well

2219
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,920
for lgd is the fact that the the one

2220
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,520
fight that they did have going in their

2221
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,520
favor it was one that gaming Gladiators

2222
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,840
handed to them they're still yet able to

2223
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,760
find anything positive with regards to

2224
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,560
starting the action themselves and

2225
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:25,119
looking to make the initiation it just

2226
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:26,639
hasn't happened from

2227
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:29,080
lgd not easy into this draft versus

2228
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,719
these bruisers versus these tanky tanky

2229
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:32,880
cores and yeah the early bkb from Dao

2230
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,599
it's going to cause some big issues how

2231
01:41:34,599 --> 01:41:35,760
who do they really want to focus fire

2232
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,280
now at this point do you focus fire The

2233
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:38,760
bkb Alchemist you probably have to go

2234
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:39,880
for these supports cuz these front

2235
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:41,080
liners are just going to pretty much

2236
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:42,400
absorb everything that you throw at them

2237
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,159
so Tower is under attack at the moment

2238
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:46,440
no egg for 30 seconds

2239
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:49,400
gaming that farm don't win he able to

2240
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,119
dive away here while you smile but Ace

2241
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:54,679
is closing in upon him he why you smile

2242
01:41:54,679 --> 01:41:57,080
no egg no dive at the ready there's no

2243
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:00,599
chance for survival another

2244
01:42:00,599 --> 01:42:04,520
kill nothing to say he is very deep he's

2245
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,239
going to be okay gets the charge off in

2246
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:08,960
time before draa is able to find

2247
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:11,280
himom to so still doing his best to pick

2248
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,599
up what he can across the map and

2249
01:42:12,599 --> 01:42:14,400
continue to try and catch up to towards

2250
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,560
getting that octarine done and still

2251
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,400
going to take time though for him going

2252
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,599
to take time and it's always still going

2253
01:42:19,599 --> 01:42:21,480
to be issues cuz he doesn't have ways to

2254
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:23,639
really protect himself besides that this

2255
01:42:23,639 --> 01:42:25,159
big burst that comes out from Reaper the

2256
01:42:25,159 --> 01:42:26,320
grab that comes out from the Primal

2257
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,440
Beast always going to be an issue for

2258
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:28,280
this

2259
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:31,280
breaker Dao on The Alchemist blink dag

2260
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,920
around the corner next time round he

2261
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:34,560
will be able to get that catch and they

2262
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:35,400
will be able to get the double

2263
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:36,679
connections constantly with the soul

2264
01:42:36,679 --> 01:42:38,480
bind of that as well

2265
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:41,159
too some very very difficult fights

2266
01:42:41,159 --> 01:42:42,920
ahead here for

2267
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:45,599
lgd Tower he's getting too tanky too

2268
01:42:45,599 --> 01:42:47,480
fast on the side of gaming Ace heart

2269
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:49,360
soon on the menu for him too Quinn he's

2270
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,639
got it finished even though they've got

2271
01:42:51,639 --> 01:42:53,239
this demonic Purge he's just too tanky

2272
01:42:53,239 --> 01:42:54,960
61 and three so far in this necro this

2273
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:56,960
pick seems to be a bit too much for them

2274
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,840
to deal with at the

2275
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:01,119
moment tier two now starting to get

2276
01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:03,080
pressured can they mount the defense

2277
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:05,800
here this is not an easy spot to

2278
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:08,000
fight they have got the ultimates but at

2279
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,239
the same time sod gaming Gladiators

2280
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:12,199
unless someone in lgd is able to find

2281
01:43:12,199 --> 01:43:13,599
their way to the back lines find the

2282
01:43:13,599 --> 01:43:15,119
silence Cel is going to be able to put a

2283
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:17,040
stop to any sort of Team fight that the

2284
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,000
lgd try and respond with yeah not easy

2285
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,400
for you to just like charge through or

2286
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,400
anything like that either there's a

2287
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:22,719
primal Beast there's a soul bind that's

2288
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:24,520
always going to be stopping you and

2289
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:25,960
gaming they're just playing as a unit so

2290
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:27,920
far not giving the opportunities to lgd

2291
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,320
Shir is getting some good time to get

2292
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:30,840
that farm going he's got his Manta got

2293
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:33,040
the mask of Madness but he needs more to

2294
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,080
be able to actually show up to these

2295
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:35,280
fights it feels like this is great for

2296
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:39,159
farming but definitely needs a bkb this

2297
01:43:39,159 --> 01:43:42,440
game plan it okay I mean Dao a bit far

2298
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:44,280
forward but has

2299
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:47,800
bkb Dr the AL upon Him Ace flanking

2300
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,159
tring to see if he get the grab on a y

2301
01:43:49,159 --> 01:43:51,080
smile but a quick dive is there just a

2302
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,679
bit of a poke from the supports but

2303
01:43:52,679 --> 01:43:54,440
nothing more to push gaming Gladiators

2304
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:56,040
back as they'll continue to push on and

2305
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:58,480
look to take this tier two Dao knows his

2306
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,480
strength having that s here behind him

2307
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:04,639
too a tier two default very early pre2

2308
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,440
minutes also able to hold on to the tier

2309
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,400
two top they did have quite a few Heroes

2310
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:11,480
up on this Top Lane lgd but unable to

2311
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:12,880
push the tier two

2312
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:15,760
themselves okay he always wants to play

2313
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,119
Super aggressive he wants to go for the

2314
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:19,040
SD they might be able to sandwich Planet

2315
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,639
here I think they will Ace coming in

2316
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:23,239
from the side Planet he can't run from

2317
01:44:23,239 --> 01:44:24,599
this one jump forward to the low ground

2318
01:44:24,599 --> 01:44:26,880
from Dao another kill and more gold here

2319
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,960
for The

2320
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:30,040
Alchemist just getting way too much on

2321
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:31,840
the map Quinn shows himself top they

2322
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,159
have a ward on top of them but there's

2323
01:44:33,159 --> 01:44:35,000
just no way for them to punish it they

2324
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,679
do have okay the center's kind of in the

2325
01:44:36,679 --> 01:44:39,480
area but they yeah they can't go for

2326
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:41,880
it getting very close the sort of timing

2327
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:44,159
21 minutes or so in where they're going

2328
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:45,440
to have to deal with these two cores

2329
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:46,880
that have hearts upon them you know AC

2330
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,199
is pretty much got his done Quinn's

2331
01:44:48,199 --> 01:44:50,400
already got his and a bkb Alchemist

2332
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,840
that's a lot of HP that you got to try

2333
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,280
and get through with the damage that

2334
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,000
you've got an lgd's lineup and you just

2335
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,520
s of look at the heroes and unless

2336
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,679
everything connects perfectly it's hard

2337
01:44:58,679 --> 01:45:00,440
to sort of see these situations in which

2338
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:02,400
these CA of gaming Gladiators get taken

2339
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,880
down yeah can you protect your egg

2340
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:04,880
you're going to need absolutely

2341
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,159
everything to connect perfectly it feels

2342
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:07,639
like for lgd in these next few moments

2343
01:45:07,639 --> 01:45:09,159
and for gaming the pace is going to

2344
01:45:09,159 --> 01:45:10,719
continue accelerating BR soon to be on

2345
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:12,520
the menu for them too but continuing to

2346
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,599
look to just control the map before

2347
01:45:14,599 --> 01:45:18,520
that full hyperstone now on

2348
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,159
Daio

2349
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:22,480
Tower Aline done now at least for

2350
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:24,239
nothing to say so have the higher

2351
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:26,440
frequency of weaving in and out of the

2352
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:28,159
fights with these

2353
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:30,480
charges can keep that farm going but

2354
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,000
still feels like they need more and more

2355
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,800
time which just still doesn't feel if

2356
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:35,599
it's really really benefiting them the

2357
01:45:35,599 --> 01:45:37,239
gaming has just been consistently like 6

2358
01:45:37,239 --> 01:45:38,880
AK gold lead even though they're playing

2359
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,639
versus this Midas I just sweeping the

2360
01:45:41,639 --> 01:45:44,599
map taking these towers down and lgd

2361
01:45:44,599 --> 01:45:46,119
they will not be showing up to defend

2362
01:45:46,119 --> 01:45:47,840
them oh they have this deep W already

2363
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,159
placed down

2364
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:53,440
too why has to be careful he gets any

2365
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,760
closer to this High Ground I mean even

2366
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:57,239
as he is going to get CAU daa just jumps

2367
01:45:57,239 --> 01:45:59,080
in under the tier two now they know that

2368
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:01,760
word is there but they get a free kill

2369
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,159
out of it and potentially even going to

2370
01:46:03,159 --> 01:46:04,719
get to pressure two lanes off of this

2371
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:08,159
here with da on one and coin on the

2372
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,599
other how does lgd slow this down I mean

2373
01:46:11,599 --> 01:46:12,960
they're just continue to try to get this

2374
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,880
charge of course to clear these waves

2375
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:19,040
but need more time for shirou to feel

2376
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,239
ready to

2377
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:23,119
fight yeah now bkb at the least a

2378
01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:25,760
necessity but still a couple of thousand

2379
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,599
gold away from that and the necessity of

2380
01:46:27,599 --> 01:46:29,080
course it'll help protect him but his

2381
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:30,560
damage is definitely starting to feel I

2382
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:31,560
mean it's still F to feel pretty

2383
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:33,400
lackluster even with that bkb they need

2384
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:34,719
everything to connect perfectly they

2385
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:36,440
need this egg the sun ra feels like is

2386
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:37,840
going to be probably their highest

2387
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:40,199
damage

2388
01:46:44,599 --> 01:46:46,520
potential for

2389
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:48,679
gladiators Shan is at the ready if they

2390
01:46:48,679 --> 01:46:51,440
want to look for that one first they

2391
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,239
almost have Agony also now finished up

2392
01:46:53,239 --> 01:46:54,960
on

2393
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,920
Quinn and with those early boots of

2394
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:58,239
travel that he was able to get to it's

2395
01:46:58,239 --> 01:46:59,599
always this way to answer something like

2396
01:46:59,599 --> 01:47:00,920
the spirit breaker right he goes to one

2397
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:02,400
lane clears it out and then he can go

2398
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:03,520
join his team constantly while they're

2399
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:05,400
on the hunt for this SV but nothing to

2400
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:06,920
say is doing a good job at least of

2401
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,760
keeping these waves quite cleared out

2402
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:10,440
and he's only died the three times so

2403
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:13,520
he's getting some pretty decent

2404
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:18,800
recovery buys his Shard so going to be

2405
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,320
going for that plane in Pocket to absorb

2406
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:21,960
some type of spells at least to protect

2407
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:24,480
shirro not too often I think I've seen

2408
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:27,080
people purchase

2409
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,920
it has eyes on Quinn but of course

2410
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,719
nothing really that he can do about this

2411
01:47:31,719 --> 01:47:32,800
another cool thing is I guess with the

2412
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,520
planer pocket it's a magic resist too

2413
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:37,000
75% magic resist if you eat that with a

2414
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,239
Reaper sighte you're probably just going

2415
01:47:38,239 --> 01:47:39,719
to live through it so it's going to be a

2416
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:41,040
cool itemization here from nothing to

2417
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,679
say to tank spells for

2418
01:47:42,679 --> 01:47:44,639
shirro potentially trying to cuss with

2419
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:46,119
the creep waves coming in on this Top

2420
01:47:46,119 --> 01:47:47,719
Lane but gaming glad they've already got

2421
01:47:47,719 --> 01:47:50,520
one right up to two yeah da I me he has

2422
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,520
AC done he's just brood forcing these

2423
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:56,040
towers the map shrinking more and

2424
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:58,800
more shro with the Illusions trying to

2425
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,400
at least hold back the waves in the mid

2426
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:03,639
lane bkb is

2427
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:07,880
finished definitely feels like moments

2428
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:09,560
away from gaming Gladiators maybe trying

2429
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:11,320
their look at a high ground push as I

2430
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:13,400
say though Roshan is there so probably

2431
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:15,159
going to they'll go for the pick up on

2432
01:48:15,159 --> 01:48:16,639
that one yeah it's going to shift up top

2433
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:17,920
and about 40 seconds so I imagine

2434
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:19,400
they're going to set up around there

2435
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:20,679
that very much feels like that they're

2436
01:48:20,679 --> 01:48:22,040
in a position where they don't really

2437
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,480
need to take too many risks right now

2438
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:24,960
gaming Gladiators a prettyy comfortable

2439
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,840
hold on the

2440
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:30,000
game get the cat tofu in with the well

2441
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,239
they don't even have to use the reaper Z

2442
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:33,639
early they'll drop it now still won't

2443
01:48:33,639 --> 01:48:35,119
get the kill with it but they get the

2444
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:37,639
kill after oh that was sick by tofu what

2445
01:48:37,639 --> 01:48:41,159
a quick blink and insta popping that ink

2446
01:48:41,159 --> 01:48:43,840
swell mid to 20 seconds till that Ro

2447
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:44,760
starts shifting they're already

2448
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:47,679
positioned around the Top

2449
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,040
Lane Gaming's just kind of

2450
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:51,960
cruising playing the map it feels like

2451
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:53,239
wherever they want Even though lgd is

2452
01:48:53,239 --> 01:48:55,199
getting the farm they are completely

2453
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:56,599
avoiding every anywhere that gaming

2454
01:48:56,599 --> 01:48:59,280
gladers does

2455
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:02,639
Go lgd I mean in terms of items we'll

2456
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:03,960
see sort of what pickups they are able

2457
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,480
to get in place before this kind of Ram

2458
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,199
pickup into High Ground push that's very

2459
01:49:08,199 --> 01:49:09,400
likely to be coming in from gaming

2460
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:12,480
Gladiators does occur with the bkb it's

2461
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,320
there he's got the money for The Shard

2462
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,520
if he wants to pick that up anything to

2463
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:17,000
sort of provide him some defensive

2464
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,599
capabilities trying to get that small

2465
01:49:18,599 --> 01:49:20,599
crit online as well Shar just to have

2466
01:49:20,599 --> 01:49:22,119
some sort of damage against this

2467
01:49:22,119 --> 01:49:23,840
inevitable p push that gaming Gladiators

2468
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,599
is going to come charging them with and

2469
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:26,840
that feels it's going to be the big

2470
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:28,560
issue is will they have enough damage to

2471
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,679
go through ACE the heart Primal Beast

2472
01:49:30,679 --> 01:49:32,199
The Alchemist who's incredibly tanking

2473
01:49:32,199 --> 01:49:34,000
and this

2474
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,440
necros and now on Aegis as well too

2475
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:39,320
which they cannot contest up

2476
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,400
here the levels as well too on the

2477
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:42,320
supports I mean that's something I'm

2478
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:43,239
always going to be looking at for the

2479
01:49:43,239 --> 01:49:44,480
Phoenix it does feel like he's going to

2480
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,679
be one of the most important ones for

2481
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:48,360
the side of lgd still not level

2482
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:50,520
12 so with this pace of this game he's

2483
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:51,800
not able to find the connection to get

2484
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:54,440
those extra levels from

2485
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:56,760
as this Rush it's

2486
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:59,000
gone should be able to finish the tier

2487
01:49:59,000 --> 01:49:59,840
one

2488
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:02,599
mid get an extra bit of a cash bonus

2489
01:50:02,599 --> 01:50:03,599
here for the

2490
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:07,800
team any little bit they can get they

2491
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:12,840
need lgd have to be very careful with

2492
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:15,320
their position outside of the base right

2493
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:18,119
now are in a spot that gaming Gladiators

2494
01:50:18,119 --> 01:50:22,800
are starting to close in upon illusion

2495
01:50:23,239 --> 01:50:24,719
The High Ground surely going to be the

2496
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:27,199
best place for lgd to try and make their

2497
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:30,159
stand here against gaming Gladiators gam

2498
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:31,560
even wants to go for that High Ground

2499
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:32,800
too we'll have to wait how long they

2500
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,360
want to push the issue forward

2501
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:37,800
here shirro does find an illusion Rune

2502
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:38,800
probably one of the better ones that he

2503
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,000
get in this type of Style game where

2504
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,599
things have slowed down massively

2505
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:43,119
cutting some waves does get that top

2506
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:44,520
wave cut out

2507
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,840
there so this is the final wave that

2508
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:48,320
gaming has if they don't do want to go

2509
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,800
threaten that high ground level 18 has

2510
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:51,760
been hit on Daio see if he does threaten

2511
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:54,800
a little bit here he wants

2512
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:57,639
to he knows it's so hard for lgd to

2513
01:50:57,639 --> 01:50:59,560
punish any sort of jump that he wants to

2514
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:01,079
go for on this push yeah he can just

2515
01:51:01,079 --> 01:51:02,760
start getting the pke Quinn going to

2516
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,079
start throwing those heals out as well

2517
01:51:04,079 --> 01:51:05,520
too this Tower is dropping there's no

2518
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:08,599
GPH 13 seconds got to do something gdf

2519
01:51:08,599 --> 01:51:09,880
wise they're going to be losing a raack

2520
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,119
that was perfect timing really for

2521
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:12,440
gaming to take advantage of that glyph

2522
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:14,880
still being

2523
01:51:15,719 --> 01:51:18,360
down to clear out the Illusions and the

2524
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:20,119
ax is gone they the range they're onto

2525
01:51:20,119 --> 01:51:23,239
the melee

2526
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:24,920
now GD what's the

2527
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:27,280
plan fire Spirits for now seem to be

2528
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,719
enough to stop the the push here from

2529
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:31,239
gaming Gladiators Lan cut so Luna does

2530
01:51:31,239 --> 01:51:32,920
get both of those so no more creep wave

2531
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:34,560
up in the Top Lane so will buy them some

2532
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,199
time a nice move from shirro nothing to

2533
01:51:36,199 --> 01:51:38,800
say considering a charge but doesn't

2534
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:42,079
want to start a fight just yet into this

2535
01:51:42,079 --> 01:51:44,239
Aegis nice play from Shiro yeah a little

2536
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:45,639
illusion micro definitely making a big

2537
01:51:45,639 --> 01:51:47,440
deal there level 18 now and he does have

2538
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,960
that small crit finish so now maybe this

2539
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:50,840
is that indicator for lgd this could be

2540
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:51,679
the call where they feel like they're

2541
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:52,880
going to start having some d Dage to

2542
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:55,599
look for the fight bkb also finished on

2543
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:57,199
new so he can actually get into those

2544
01:51:57,199 --> 01:51:58,239
fights and not have to worry about just

2545
01:51:58,239 --> 01:51:59,480
getting instantly globaled and get

2546
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,760
nothing

2547
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,920
off Tower there a double damage as well

2548
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:07,119
on the top side of the river would be

2549
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:08,800
quite the pickup if lgd are able to

2550
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,159
catch wind of that one gaming they're

2551
01:52:11,159 --> 01:52:12,360
going to continue The

2552
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:14,199
Siege

2553
01:52:14,199 --> 01:52:17,199
bkb on Quinn he's also ready to go fully

2554
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:19,719
in on the push

2555
01:52:19,719 --> 01:52:23,199
Dao onto the barracks how they may just

2556
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:24,840
have to let this set go but looks of it

2557
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:26,960
this they don't try anything on the

2558
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:28,599
defensive on this one so a full set of

2559
01:52:28,599 --> 01:52:30,800
Rex will be taken down by Gladiators

2560
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:32,760
yeah still too still two and a half

2561
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:34,320
minutes left with this AIS to

2562
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:35,560
potentially push for more they are going

2563
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:36,840
to have to head back and deal with the

2564
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,599
state of the the rest of the creep waves

2565
01:52:38,599 --> 01:52:40,400
as they have been you say consistently

2566
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,719
pushed in shirou really pulling off the

2567
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:45,560
work here to keep this game

2568
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:48,000
alive charge

2569
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,480
through my

2570
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:53,880
goodness very deep positioning here

2571
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:55,000
playing around his vision though does

2572
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,400
have that Ward on The High Ground and

2573
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,040
nothing to say should be

2574
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:00,480
fine Gladiators they send drao down

2575
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,199
bottom to zal with the creep wave on

2576
01:53:02,199 --> 01:53:03,599
that lane the rest of the team ready to

2577
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:06,360
start pushing back out the mid I they're

2578
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:07,800
doing kind of the cool Maneuvers though

2579
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:09,639
where it's yeah the objectives are being

2580
01:53:09,639 --> 01:53:11,079
taken from gaming but look at the Gold

2581
01:53:11,079 --> 01:53:12,199
you know it's starting to get a little

2582
01:53:12,199 --> 01:53:13,560
bit better there for lgd with the way

2583
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:14,560
that you're just playing the full farm

2584
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:15,520
game around the map rather than

2585
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,239
contesting the push maybe feeling strong

2586
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:19,400
enough to set up for something

2587
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:22,119
themselves here lgd smoke up we have sh

2588
01:53:22,119 --> 01:53:23,520
feeling that they're now at a point

2589
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,719
where they can try for for for looking

2590
01:53:25,719 --> 01:53:27,199
for a team

2591
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:29,679
fight Dao on the front lines though the

2592
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:33,079
DD still in the Top

2593
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:35,880
Lane I mean ideally who who you finding

2594
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:37,320
here do you do you want something like

2595
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:38,599
the quick squishy Heroes you want to get

2596
01:53:38,599 --> 01:53:40,159
on the silencer first take him out you

2597
01:53:40,159 --> 01:53:41,400
know what would be the ideal catch for

2598
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:42,719
lgd you probably at least want to know

2599
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:44,119
where the silencer is and someone has to

2600
01:53:44,119 --> 01:53:45,400
stop the global to come out but we'll

2601
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:46,719
see who they want to jump first they've

2602
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:48,360
got eyes on the two of them those

2603
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:49,760
interrupt the initial attempt from you

2604
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:50,960
the global silence comes out the

2605
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,960
Supernova is there but gaming gladi

2606
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,840
they can fight this out keep to the

2607
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:56,639
distance Ace will get caught by initial

2608
01:53:56,639 --> 01:53:58,840
St but he

2609
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:01,599
SOB the grab as well drer picks up the

2610
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:03,320
double shro he's got the bkb in the

2611
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:05,119
eclipse Ace he's someh still alive

2612
01:54:05,119 --> 01:54:06,520
finally he'll fall as nothing to say

2613
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:08,920
takes him out with the ultimate C able

2614
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:11,239
to bkb TP out so lgd at least able to

2615
01:54:11,239 --> 01:54:13,679
cut their losses there and they do find

2616
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:15,719
a kill in return in that fight nothing

2617
01:54:15,719 --> 01:54:18,520
to say only just able to catch a

2618
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:20,440
underneath the tower so something to be

2619
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:22,840
found but still not quite what GD were

2620
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:24,199
hoping for and look how much they have

2621
01:54:24,199 --> 01:54:25,520
to commit just to kill Ace and he

2622
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:26,920
actually had the bkb coming out on The

2623
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:28,159
Courier so it's good that they got the

2624
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:30,000
jump right there otherwise he absolutely

2625
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,239
just lives and now down the mid they go

2626
01:54:32,239 --> 01:54:34,679
gacho St has 30 seconds with this AIS

2627
01:54:34,679 --> 01:54:37,280
Quinn backing him up they used

2628
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:39,040
absolutely everything there on the side

2629
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:41,480
of lgd no bkb at ready for Shiro him

2630
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:43,199
walking up he could just get exploded

2631
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:44,400
instantly if he

2632
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:46,719
does yeah not a not a great fight of

2633
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:48,000
course for lgd but it definitely could

2634
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,480
have gone a lot worse if they lost their

2635
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:50,679
lunar in that

2636
01:54:50,679 --> 01:54:52,480
situation it would have been rough

2637
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:53,840
nothing to say trying to clear out the

2638
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,560
way put a stop push there in with the

2639
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:58,560
sub a lot of damage Rao's down

2640
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:01,079
once has got his bkb ready here for the

2641
01:55:01,079 --> 01:55:02,760
second round he's got the blink as well

2642
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:03,920
he's going to be out nothing to say

2643
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:05,599
though he charges forward inst gets

2644
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:06,800
clipped by the Phantoms Embrace from

2645
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,360
tofu they tell him with a slow jump

2646
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:09,480
forward again they're trying to control

2647
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:11,000
the spirit breaker they'll throw out the

2648
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,040
dust Another slow not going to connect

2649
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:14,480
so Ace trying to close in but the

2650
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:16,320
charges back up nothing to say able to

2651
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:19,840
put a stop to the push and get

2652
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:23,280
away we'll live to see another day to

2653
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:24,639
we'll be

2654
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:26,599
okay and they're looking to keep going

2655
01:55:26,599 --> 01:55:29,280
how long on this egg 20

2656
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,480
seconds full butterfly now for sh I mean

2657
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:34,239
Shir he he's he's silently slowly he's

2658
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:37,400
he's doing it you know the Farm is

2659
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:40,360
there they keep him alive bkb is back up

2660
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:43,040
can they protect

2661
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:48,760
him P just continue to commence LIF

2662
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:51,040
still cool down for about 4 minutes who

2663
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,079
goes in first if for lgd got to be new

2664
01:55:53,079 --> 01:55:54,560
and look at Dao the whole time he's been

2665
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:56,040
doing this turning that Radiance off

2666
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:58,040
consistently when he's going for the in

2667
01:55:58,040 --> 01:55:59,400
the bkb's off just in time there for

2668
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:00,920
sure is still going to get C by the sine

2669
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:02,719
he tried to turn it with the lips Ace is

2670
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:06,239
falling low focus on able to take down a

2671
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:07,679
back up the running away the bkb but the

2672
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:09,400
physical damage is coming in drao

2673
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:10,639
finally able to keep to his distance

2674
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:12,239
quck gets back in on the

2675
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:15,480
mid he's able to finish off Shiro Quinn

2676
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:17,880
taking down the Luna shirro out with no

2677
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:20,760
buyback available he's spent up for the

2678
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:23,239
butterfly see

2679
01:56:23,239 --> 01:56:24,320
the disrupt but they're not going to be

2680
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:25,599
able to find anything more that I mean

2681
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:28,079
it look a solid defense from lgd but the

2682
01:56:28,079 --> 01:56:29,639
fact that Quinn he knew that he could

2683
01:56:29,639 --> 01:56:31,639
get straight back in there finish off

2684
01:56:31,639 --> 01:56:33,960
the Luna it's a big kill to be found

2685
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:35,520
because if Shir survives through that

2686
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:37,199
lgd they definitely be looking to make a

2687
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:39,000
play Within this next minute with shirro

2688
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,079
going down there because of that play

2689
01:56:40,079 --> 01:56:42,159
from Quinn LG they'll have to hold back

2690
01:56:42,159 --> 01:56:43,880
once more look how much damage shirro

2691
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:46,159
was able to do I Ace pop bkb and just

2692
01:56:46,159 --> 01:56:47,880
literally died in seconds I think he had

2693
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:49,560
even had like the vindicator's a bonus

2694
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:51,360
armor he literally died so fast trying

2695
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,360
to get the double grab but Quinn that

2696
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:54,800
was a really cool call to make like you

2697
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:56,480
see Dao drops to what I think it was

2698
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:58,400
like 100 HP or something like that Quinn

2699
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:00,119
just jumps into four or five Heroes and

2700
01:57:00,119 --> 01:57:01,719
ends up just getting away because of it

2701
01:57:01,719 --> 01:57:03,119
yeah the these players really knowing

2702
01:57:03,119 --> 01:57:04,440
their limits we sort of saw it yesterday

2703
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:06,639
rightor and his morph wait for me into

2704
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:08,320
these crazy situations this game is

2705
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:09,719
Quinn just going right into the midst of

2706
01:57:09,719 --> 01:57:11,880
pretty much what four Heroes take to

2707
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:14,159
take down that crucial kill and keep

2708
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:15,480
this game for now held in gaming

2709
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:17,119
Gladiators favor definitely seeing

2710
01:57:17,119 --> 01:57:19,159
though that shirro if they do if they

2711
01:57:19,159 --> 01:57:20,239
don't kill if they don't give him the

2712
01:57:20,239 --> 01:57:21,719
respect he is going to be doing a lot of

2713
01:57:21,719 --> 01:57:24,679
damage now at this point with this

2714
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:29,040
butterfly keeping this game alive here

2715
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:31,280
lgd it's consistently just been sitting

2716
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:34,079
at that 6K gold

2717
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,000
lead and high ground it's always going

2718
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,079
to be the best place for them to get

2719
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:39,199
this defense it's always going to allow

2720
01:57:39,199 --> 01:57:40,840
W smile to have kind of like perfect

2721
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:42,760
positioning with his egg and sunr

2722
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:43,679
they're looking to actually make an

2723
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:44,679
aggressive move themselves they're

2724
01:57:44,679 --> 01:57:46,040
feeling confident perhaps after that

2725
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:47,639
last fight it was very close to them

2726
01:57:47,639 --> 01:57:49,159
just wiping you know pretty much

2727
01:57:49,159 --> 01:57:50,560
everybody there on the side of gaming so

2728
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:52,320
don't blame them if they feel quite a

2729
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,280
bit more confident now might see a smoke

2730
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:55,880
from gaming Gladiators themselves as

2731
01:57:55,880 --> 01:57:58,639
well yeah celeries ready to pop it on

2732
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:00,079
smoke maybe reading the movements I mean

2733
01:58:00,079 --> 01:58:02,480
RIT soon going to be coming

2734
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:04,760
up new pick up as well for nothing to

2735
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:07,320
say has his Lincoln so not easy as as it

2736
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:09,119
before to sort of set up from any of

2737
01:58:09,119 --> 01:58:10,800
these single Target disruptions or plays

2738
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:14,440
from gaming Gladiators Ro it's a long

2739
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:18,159
spawn Ace smoke to spell both teams

2740
01:58:18,159 --> 01:58:21,679
aware of one another

2741
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:23,920
Tacho looks like he's potentially

2742
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:25,480
setting up for something here they see

2743
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:26,760
up around this top Rune he's actually

2744
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:28,560
going to go for nothing to say bulldo

2745
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,840
and Lincoln will eat it be

2746
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:34,840
okay

2747
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:38,920
Tower L GD time being bot chiro getting

2748
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:40,880
bigger and bigger getting these buff UPS

2749
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,320
too I saw the solo Crest picked up

2750
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:43,760
before that last fight as well too from

2751
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:45,040
Wu smile they're starting to throw their

2752
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:49,280
eggs into this Luna basket

2753
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:56,520
Ro one and a half GD getting more and

2754
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,719
more time I think they'll want to try

2755
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:00,960
and contest this Roan though yes they

2756
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:02,360
certainly feel a whole lot stronger

2757
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:04,159
right now GD yeah especially I mean with

2758
01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:06,119
the Lincoln in particular for nothing to

2759
01:59:06,119 --> 01:59:07,159
say now he's going to be able to just

2760
01:59:07,159 --> 01:59:08,760
straight charge through these fights and

2761
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:10,360
perhaps just eat one of these big spells

2762
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:12,079
or two especially with planer pocket too

2763
01:59:12,079 --> 01:59:15,560
right could just tank it off one of his

2764
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:17,760
teammates gaming going to play patient

2765
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,800
around here but that does potentially

2766
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:20,880
mean that this map is going to get

2767
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:23,360
farmed out from nothing to say from

2768
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:25,679
Shiro satanic soon on the horizon for

2769
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:27,639
shirro gladiators they want to try and

2770
01:59:27,639 --> 01:59:30,800
look for the hit before the RO

2771
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:33,360
spawns can they get an angle they highly

2772
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:36,119
suspect that lgd will start to to set up

2773
01:59:36,119 --> 01:59:39,880
outside of the base they send themselves

2774
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:41,320
but The High Ground here who are they

2775
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:43,239
with the jump upon drao goes towards the

2776
01:59:43,239 --> 01:59:44,800
creeps not going to find anyone there

2777
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,079
though so they're in towards the

2778
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:47,159
triangle

2779
01:59:47,159 --> 01:59:52,000
lgd that was close to disaster

2780
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:54,840
Lanes just being shoved in though look

2781
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:56,599
at bottom and mid nothing to say has

2782
01:59:56,599 --> 01:59:58,040
completely pushed those into the tier

2783
01:59:58,040 --> 01:59:59,400
twos now at this

2784
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:03,960
point new and

2785
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:08,040
gu able to get

2786
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:11,320
away 15 seconds Ro they know it's got to

2787
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:12,880
be up soon gaming just continue to play

2788
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:14,599
in that corner area lgd's got to get

2789
02:00:14,599 --> 02:00:15,400
over

2790
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:17,920
here SM up from the Z this time full

2791
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,840
satanic done on Shar check this illusion

2792
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:21,400
push in mid Quin he's actually got to go

2793
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:23,079
answer it a little here double catapult

2794
02:00:23,079 --> 02:00:25,719
wave with these double

2795
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:29,320
Illusions and lgd smoked up they saw

2796
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:30,480
Quinn move this could be their

2797
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:33,159
opportunity to strike 28 seconds no TP

2798
02:00:33,159 --> 02:00:36,400
for Quinn to join his team Tower getting

2799
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:37,320
all these little lmes the fact that

2800
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:39,239
they've now got oh at position two Lotus

2801
02:00:39,239 --> 02:00:41,560
ORS ready for the next fight shirro my

2802
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:44,440
goodness look at new he knows he

2803
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:47,079
knows perfect to the side they eliminate

2804
02:00:47,079 --> 02:00:49,360
toy they take down Gario they'll be able

2805
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:51,199
to bring down celer as well as gaming

2806
02:00:51,199 --> 02:00:53,079
Gladiator tra in the corner they didn't

2807
02:00:53,079 --> 02:00:54,679
quite have the detection for CIO Ys

2808
02:00:54,679 --> 02:00:56,320
himself up but there's no Escape for

2809
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,480
this silencer so sick I mean just

2810
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:00,159
trapped in the corner the Gladiators

2811
02:01:00,159 --> 02:01:01,719
they were not ready for lgd to come and

2812
02:01:01,719 --> 02:01:03,480
pins them in and now open up the

2813
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:05,960
opportunity for lgd to head into the pit

2814
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:08,119
and get roam for themselves it's the big

2815
02:01:08,119 --> 02:01:09,800
brain split push plays that were coming

2816
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:11,679
out spare breaker cutting bottom Luna

2817
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:14,040
cutting mid eventually someone reacts as

2818
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:17,000
soon as they see Quinn no hesitation

2819
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,520
they know exactly where they were the

2820
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:20,079
way that they've held on in this game

2821
02:01:20,079 --> 02:01:22,320
kept their call now they striking back

2822
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:23,760
and they're striking back hard

2823
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:25,560
Gladiators are going to be shaken in

2824
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:26,760
their boots a little bit with the way

2825
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:28,560
that these last few fights have gone

2826
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:30,760
these moves absolutely huge for lgd as

2827
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:32,840
lgd now starting to take the lead in

2828
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:34,520
this game I mean Shiro is pretty much

2829
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:35,760
completely neck and neck with that

2830
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:38,719
Alchemist now and an

2831
02:01:38,719 --> 02:01:40,760
ages really feels like some of the best

2832
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:41,960
Luna performance we've seen really

2833
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:43,920
honestly with how Shiro's done in terms

2834
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:45,599
of finding the farm keeping the game

2835
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:47,360
alive with his sort of the map movements

2836
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:49,000
of himself and the Illusions he's been

2837
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,920
doing so much I mean him had nothing to

2838
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:52,639
say even though you don't

2839
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:54,159
it's like this invisible kind of impact

2840
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:55,920
from this Spirit breaker but the amount

2841
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:57,360
of space that he's been able to make

2842
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:58,800
just clearing creep waves with this

2843
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,840
charge he gotten them completely back

2844
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:02,159
into it and now they're potentially the

2845
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:03,719
ones going for this High absolutely I

2846
02:02:03,719 --> 02:02:05,560
mean now for gaming Gladiators now that

2847
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:06,719
they're playing from behind how does

2848
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:08,079
this change things up for them what sort

2849
02:02:08,079 --> 02:02:09,480
of conversations you think is going on

2850
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:11,760
right now in the Gladiators boost good

2851
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:13,040
question they're probably still feeling

2852
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:14,239
pretty confident with their fight but

2853
02:02:14,239 --> 02:02:15,199
they're definitely feeling a little bit

2854
02:02:15,199 --> 02:02:17,400
more scared of this Luna they probably

2855
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:18,760
need to start figuring out the answer

2856
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:20,440
for nothing to say cuz he's just getting

2857
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:22,639
way too big on this SP breaker now too

2858
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:24,920
in the bottle got everything ready she

2859
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:26,480
very close by, gold away from being a to

2860
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:29,360
pick up the full L as well this Luna an

2861
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:32,800
absolute Terror in these team

2862
02:02:33,119 --> 02:02:35,520
fights I mean w smile is also queuing up

2863
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:36,719
for the big play he's going for that

2864
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:38,159
refresher feeling they do not have an

2865
02:02:38,159 --> 02:02:39,239
answer for the egg if they don't get the

2866
02:02:39,239 --> 02:02:40,599
global off he's going to get these eggs

2867
02:02:40,599 --> 02:02:43,320
off every single

2868
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:48,320
time

2869
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:50,719
ooh see with Shiro we'll see what Shir

2870
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:52,960
does does go down this route

2871
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:54,199
changing item builds a little bit but he

2872
02:02:54,199 --> 02:02:56,280
is just going to go

2873
02:02:56,280 --> 02:03:00,920
dataless btom Tower ATT gladi do they

2874
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:02,639
want to try and fight into the ages

2875
02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:04,920
three and a half minutes here for

2876
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:06,679
shirro they don't have the same way to

2877
02:03:06,679 --> 02:03:08,199
be able to push these waves and visibly

2878
02:03:08,199 --> 02:03:09,560
right like now it's difficult for them

2879
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:10,760
to actually keep their Lanes pushed out

2880
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:12,239
they don't have these illusion pushes

2881
02:03:12,239 --> 02:03:13,360
they don't have the spirit breaker kind

2882
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:14,599
of charge thing to be able to deal with

2883
02:03:14,599 --> 02:03:16,239
it so they kind of have to stick as this

2884
02:03:16,239 --> 02:03:18,040
unit now on gaming Gladiators for the

2885
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:19,520
next probably for these next like 2

2886
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:22,679
three minutes

2887
02:03:22,679 --> 02:03:25,480
lgd patiently waiting be able to find

2888
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:27,119
the demon Edge a big kill they do

2889
02:03:27,119 --> 02:03:28,360
they'll be able to stop a bit of that

2890
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:30,520
damage being buil up by Dao Shir he's

2891
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:32,599
ready to start pushing it I mean this

2892
02:03:32,599 --> 02:03:34,520
building dies quick versus the DD forces

2893
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:36,360
out the fortification now it's

2894
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:37,760
gladiator's turn to try and do something

2895
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:38,960
on the defensive we'll see if they're

2896
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:40,800
able to put a stop to this one I mean as

2897
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,320
soon as that Tower drops these racks are

2898
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:43,840
going to drop in seconds trying and get

2899
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:45,880
the jump on his sh of the man part A has

2900
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:47,199
to back away nothing to say him with the

2901
02:03:47,199 --> 02:03:49,800
charge but gets push backo trying go the

2902
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:51,840
Ki but it's on to the illusion shirro

2903
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:53,840
put the bkb starting to get a bit low

2904
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:55,239
himself doesn't feel confident even

2905
02:03:55,239 --> 02:03:56,480
though he has the ages to finish off the

2906
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:58,599
racks he'll back off for now dless now

2907
02:03:58,599 --> 02:04:00,239
picked up that was pretty cool from Dao

2908
02:04:00,239 --> 02:04:01,920
actually doesn't have to use his bkb

2909
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:03,199
doesn't he's scared about the reflection

2910
02:04:03,199 --> 02:04:05,159
of the concoction actually forces shirro

2911
02:04:05,159 --> 02:04:08,400
to use his they'll back away I they've

2912
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:10,000
got so many ways as well to to sort of

2913
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,880
buff up and protect Shir on the pushes

2914
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:13,520
right with the Lotus picked up by new

2915
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:15,239
the Lotus picked up by Planet so many

2916
02:04:15,239 --> 02:04:16,840
things to just throw upon this Luna and

2917
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:18,840
just allow Shir to get in and do the

2918
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:20,719
damage lgd they may have been pushed

2919
02:04:20,719 --> 02:04:21,880
back but I'm pretty sure they we looking

2920
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:23,440
to go again still two minutes to play

2921
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:25,360
aggressive with the agis yeah some nice

2922
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:26,639
itemization I mean playing into the

2923
02:04:26,639 --> 02:04:28,440
silencer playing into necro even even

2924
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:30,559
Grim struck Ian this this Lotus could be

2925
02:04:30,559 --> 02:04:33,119
incredibly

2926
02:04:33,719 --> 02:04:35,960
effective gaming now bit trapped inside

2927
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:36,960
their own

2928
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,040
base Dao they're going to get the jump

2929
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:41,119
on him open things up they'll drop the

2930
02:04:41,119 --> 02:04:43,239
global but the super over time with the

2931
02:04:43,239 --> 02:04:47,280
r it burst through Dao he's for 75 new

2932
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:49,040
OG seal toing forward they're pushing in

2933
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:50,400
on the mid lane they'll be ready to

2934
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:51,760
approach The High Ground again and maybe

2935
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:53,679
even Force out this P back from Dao he's

2936
02:04:53,679 --> 02:04:54,840
out for

2937
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:57,880
70 Quinn now Quinn also HS a Lo and beam

2938
02:04:57,880 --> 02:04:59,119
charging from nothing to say knocks it

2939
02:04:59,119 --> 02:05:01,960
back as well the the bkb is out qu backs

2940
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:04,000
away the turn of the sine jump forward

2941
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,679
Dr Tri to get the ab BL St but it's on

2942
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:07,800
the L stuns himself Ace in the mid to

2943
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:09,679
the mdle the s's coming it takes nothing

2944
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:12,079
to say down there's a he's getting

2945
02:05:12,079 --> 02:05:15,040
completely trampled upon by

2946
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:17,320
Ace can they do it a second time round

2947
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:19,599
bkb is still on C out for 2 seconds he's

2948
02:05:19,599 --> 02:05:20,760
going to have it up now he's ready to

2949
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:22,800
press he ready to turn looks toward with

2950
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:24,840
a Lo be but he crashing across the two

2951
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:27,960
of them sh he's ding the the BB com to

2952
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:32,079
get sh able to TP out as he as game you

2953
02:05:32,079 --> 02:05:35,079
will not as Gladiators they'll find you

2954
02:05:35,079 --> 02:05:37,280
but they won't get anything else no I

2955
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:40,800
don't know how but be able to live there

2956
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,400
despite his bkb coming to an end I mean

2957
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:43,639
both s the things around that the fact

2958
02:05:43,639 --> 02:05:46,159
that his bkb came back up just in time

2959
02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:47,639
from be able to survive that initial

2960
02:05:47,639 --> 02:05:49,520
burst from Gladiators and then even

2961
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:51,280
though it was a short one he still he's

2962
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:53,920
able a TP away both teams expending a

2963
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:55,360
buyback directo with a buyback for

2964
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:57,280
gladiators nothing to say with a buyback

2965
02:05:57,280 --> 02:06:00,559
from from lgd Quin is still a definite

2966
02:06:00,559 --> 02:06:01,679
problem for them though I'm seeing him

2967
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:03,719
in these fights just absolutely wrecking

2968
02:06:03,719 --> 02:06:05,800
everybody he gets ignored for a second

2969
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:08,000
and like I watch Z pops a tanic and turn

2970
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,040
to try to hit I'm just watching his

2971
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:10,760
health actually going down anyway so

2972
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:12,280
does still have to be

2973
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:14,119
careful still showing that it's

2974
02:06:14,119 --> 02:06:16,199
anybody's game these though going to be

2975
02:06:16,199 --> 02:06:18,440
very crucial Dao having to his use last

2976
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:20,199
having H use his for the defense there

2977
02:06:20,199 --> 02:06:22,000
and then also now Spirit Break nothing

2978
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,440
to say he used his to try to join that

2979
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:25,719
pre afterwards he got worried he got the

2980
02:06:25,719 --> 02:06:27,480
bkb purchased as well now ready for the

2981
02:06:27,480 --> 02:06:29,559
next fight so a new bkb on him close to

2982
02:06:29,559 --> 02:06:32,960
25 as well on nothing to say mkb now

2983
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,440
finally done with the Cur coming back up

2984
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:36,040
D is able to pick up his demon Edge big

2985
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:38,639
it hex for Quinn they have two different

2986
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:39,920
ways now to be able to go for these big

2987
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:41,679
plays to go for this big double plays as

2988
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:43,880
well too with the grimstroke more and

2989
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:45,400
more ways to break this Lincoln more and

2990
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:49,559
more ways to go for nothing to say

2991
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:54,880
tofa with his Agony of course finished

2992
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:57,400
up all now another element that lgd does

2993
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:59,840
have to answer this this Luna illusion

2994
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:02,639
is going to be terrifying oh it is we've

2995
02:07:02,639 --> 02:07:04,719
seen many many times how much this dark

2996
02:07:04,719 --> 02:07:06,400
portrait can do against the right carry

2997
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:07,800
and against this shirro lunar is

2998
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:09,320
certainly the one to to get a dark

2999
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:10,679
portrait upon if they have these

3000
02:07:10,679 --> 02:07:13,320
butterfly but to have on these dark

3001
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:15,880
portraits sh trying to close in the sign

3002
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:16,960
to get the he as well but he will loow

3003
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:19,119
just back over towards Quin with is a

3004
02:07:19,119 --> 02:07:20,800
three man who stop the charge a

3005
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,599
beautiful jump from you gaming

3006
02:07:22,599 --> 02:07:25,159
Gladiators they have to run bkb for Dro

3007
02:07:25,159 --> 02:07:26,960
is on the retreat another Char for for

3008
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:28,760
nothing over towards Ace Quinn getting

3009
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:30,840
completely kite this lgd back off away

3010
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:33,400
from him during his

3011
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:36,559
bkb again Cates there whoop into the

3012
02:07:36,559 --> 02:07:37,679
charge do they have the damage to

3013
02:07:37,679 --> 02:07:39,159
threaten Quinn the buback going to be

3014
02:07:39,159 --> 02:07:40,960
coming out from to turn back over

3015
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:43,199
they've got

3016
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:46,159
the the side K but he's still going to

3017
02:07:46,159 --> 02:07:48,119
be kep the ground they finish him off sh

3018
02:07:48,119 --> 02:07:49,840
out of the game the T what nothing to

3019
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:51,960
say nothing to say he has no bu back he

3020
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:53,840
canot afford to get CAU and he won't

3021
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:56,159
charges over towards the mid they back

3022
02:07:56,159 --> 02:07:59,800
up can he get away T over look like they

3023
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:00,960
have the detection here on the front

3024
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:03,239
line so nothing to say he'll live a big

3025
02:08:03,239 --> 02:08:05,320
escape from him if he goes down he's

3026
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:07,239
down for 2 minutes I mean massive stun

3027
02:08:07,239 --> 02:08:09,480
from new but still the issue is Quinn

3028
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:11,280
he's zoning four Heroes away while

3029
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:12,880
protecting his allies and they find the

3030
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:15,000
big one they take shirro out buyback is

3031
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,280
available for him we'll see how much

3032
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:18,320
they're able to take here gaming

3033
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:19,719
Gladiators before the BuyBacks come out

3034
02:08:19,719 --> 02:08:22,320
from lgd as drao in on the mid lane tier

3035
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:24,480
three are gone onto the back STS to buy

3036
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:27,880
back gaming Gladiators they respect it

3037
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:30,079
immediately they got out big there on

3038
02:08:30,079 --> 02:08:32,239
the side of gaming forcing these

3039
02:08:32,239 --> 02:08:37,320
BuyBacks Ro 50 seconds till coming back

3040
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:41,960
up how do they come wi actually like

3041
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:43,480
he's really just zoning four or five

3042
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:44,920
Heroes away constantly even though his

3043
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:46,320
Alchemist is getting burst in a lot of

3044
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:48,360
these situations quinnn he is a standing

3045
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:50,760
on 91 and six so far in this necro sort

3046
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:52,520
of offend wi in terms of the items we're

3047
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:54,040
seeing lgd just feeling that they have

3048
02:08:54,040 --> 02:08:56,559
to lean towards the defensive you is

3049
02:08:56,559 --> 02:08:58,119
queing up himself a Lincoln SPH for the

3050
02:08:58,119 --> 02:08:59,679
next item this really doesn't want to

3051
02:08:59,679 --> 02:09:01,880
get caught or suffer the threat of being

3052
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:03,639
just jumped upon by this instant hex

3053
02:09:03,639 --> 02:09:06,079
catch from Quinn hey lotuses and Lincoln

3054
02:09:06,079 --> 02:09:07,400
definely are the dream versus these

3055
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:09,320
single Target abilities but I don't know

3056
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:10,880
I'm seeing him switching a lot okay now

3057
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:12,679
he's got the r up I saw him do this

3058
02:09:12,679 --> 02:09:14,559
before we get that one maybe he feels

3059
02:09:14,559 --> 02:09:15,760
like he does need it just be able to

3060
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:18,239
bring down this necro cuz their overall

3061
02:09:18,239 --> 02:09:19,920
damage it's not fast enough to kill him

3062
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:21,199
it seems like he's getting this regen

3063
02:09:21,199 --> 02:09:23,079
just to build up constantly and yeah

3064
02:09:23,079 --> 02:09:24,480
just the overall damage he does in these

3065
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,719
team

3066
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:31,079
fights NE and still 6K lead back up for

3067
02:09:31,079 --> 02:09:32,880
gaming a lot of BuyBacks of course use

3068
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:35,520
the most important thing here lgd used

3069
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:37,360
quite a bit there they did the big one

3070
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:39,079
Shiro and nothing to

3071
02:09:39,079 --> 02:09:41,280
say but it's time for their of course

3072
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:43,440
over on the side of game Gladiators Duro

3073
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:45,000
still on the three minute cool down

3074
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,040
himself absolutely 2 minutes or so until

3075
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:50,360
we see rosam back in the game ninja gear

3076
02:09:50,360 --> 02:09:53,079
picked up for Dao 25 also has been

3077
02:09:53,079 --> 02:09:54,960
attained could make the difference as

3078
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:57,360
well those last few jumps of Dao they

3079
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:59,719
have been kind of caught out by the lot

3080
02:09:59,719 --> 02:10:00,960
they're able to get out this time maybe

3081
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:02,400
making the jump from the ninja gear

3082
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:04,440
smoke up could allow him to get in with

3083
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:06,320
that opening Abyssal blade before lgd

3084
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:07,800
can react this could also be a big

3085
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,400
difference maker in the fight s now has

3086
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:11,360
the refresher we' seeing some fantastic

3087
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:13,199
eggs and sunrays come out from him he

3088
02:10:13,199 --> 02:10:14,559
can now have that double of course and

3089
02:10:14,559 --> 02:10:18,000
he's level 18 y there that big

3090
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,320
one his Mana pool is quite lackluster

3091
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:21,760
though I think he's lost a bit of he's

3092
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:25,880
at 699 Mana so pretty much has to just

3093
02:10:25,880 --> 02:10:27,599
refresh her an egg has to be a little

3094
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:29,639
bit careful about that secondary gaming

3095
02:10:29,639 --> 02:10:31,880
Gladiator is ready for this oneart they

3096
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:32,840
smoked up

3097
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:35,360
new charge coming in trying to get some

3098
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:36,320
information nothing to say get some

3099
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:37,760
Vision here for maybe New to follow up

3100
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:38,920
with a potential h on the Illusions

3101
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:40,040
they're pressuring in on the mid line as

3102
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:41,199
well gaming Gladiators they might have

3103
02:10:41,199 --> 02:10:42,679
to do something about this it's going to

3104
02:10:42,679 --> 02:10:44,040
be a fair bit of damage done potentially

3105
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:45,440
with these creep WS pushing in I don't

3106
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:46,800
think they want to go back though last

3107
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,880
time the Quinn went

3108
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:51,360
back his Barracks are taking quite the

3109
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:54,119
hit in the mid lanane likely to fall I

3110
02:10:54,119 --> 02:10:56,079
mean these these losing yeah they have

3111
02:10:56,079 --> 02:10:57,840
to put the fortification at least there

3112
02:10:57,840 --> 02:10:59,559
and Quinn is walking back okay so he's

3113
02:10:59,559 --> 02:11:01,000
trying to save his TP to be able to join

3114
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,360
his team but yeah the racks at least the

3115
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:05,760
range racks might just fall down they

3116
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:08,239
finish it off Ro 30 seconds this sort of

3117
02:11:08,239 --> 02:11:09,760
the slightly longer respawn so

3118
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:11,159
definitely working in favor of gaming

3119
02:11:11,159 --> 02:11:12,719
Gladiator is allowing them time to get

3120
02:11:12,719 --> 02:11:14,040
back and hold the base and maybe get

3121
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:15,719
back over towards the pit if they do

3122
02:11:15,719 --> 02:11:17,480
want to try and contest lgd in this

3123
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:18,840
position do they have a I don't think

3124
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:19,960
they have a smoke left on the side of

3125
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:21,000
gaming though they have a couple ninja

3126
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,639
gears I don't see a smoke on them to

3127
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:24,320
make it their way back up there they're

3128
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:25,800
going to go as a

3129
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:27,599
unit I mean do you think you have to

3130
02:11:27,599 --> 02:11:29,679
still try and force this fight or do you

3131
02:11:29,679 --> 02:11:31,119
now what's the call here from Gladiators

3132
02:11:31,119 --> 02:11:32,840
this could be a difficult fight to take

3133
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:33,760
they probably still want to fight cuz

3134
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:34,920
they feel maybe like they have like some

3135
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:36,119
of this number Advantage with Quinn

3136
02:11:36,119 --> 02:11:38,480
having this

3137
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:42,599
buyback got to make the call quick

3138
02:11:42,599 --> 02:11:44,119
though cuz this Roa dies in oh he going

3139
02:11:44,119 --> 02:11:45,079
to be going down quickly there's the

3140
02:11:45,079 --> 02:11:46,639
smoke delivered out gaming Gladiators

3141
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:47,960
they'll start to head towards the pit

3142
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:49,559
but they've got to do it fast look at

3143
02:11:49,559 --> 02:11:50,960
the positioning from nothing to say be

3144
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:52,159
able toing break the smoke he's in on

3145
02:11:52,159 --> 02:11:53,440
The High Ground it's going to be hard

3146
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:55,159
for gladiators to get past him Shir

3147
02:11:55,159 --> 02:11:57,760
getting the space to finish off a to get

3148
02:11:57,760 --> 02:11:58,960
the grab they turn straight away the

3149
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:00,280
side comes down nothing say he's able to

3150
02:12:00,280 --> 02:12:02,000
put the bkb jump for fromation nothing

3151
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,679
to say he's able to live for that he's

3152
02:12:03,679 --> 02:12:06,520
on the egg with the chemical to take Tak

3153
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:09,480
the over turn over put

3154
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:13,320
the with the T gets the AG on tries to

3155
02:12:13,320 --> 02:12:14,760
stand his ground against him but he's

3156
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:16,520
caught by the disruption they're on to

3157
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,480
the Luna the Luna's out the watch he's

3158
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:19,960
not got a lot of buyback this second

3159
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:22,280
life here for cherro could a rough one

3160
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:24,960
he's able to get out of this one G he's

3161
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,480
big up the rap here he's not able to get

3162
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:28,000
out he tries to put the refresher but

3163
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:31,440
he's he's he's out and he just SP up his

3164
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:33,320
buyback of course still on cool down he

3165
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:35,400
is out of the game for two minutes a

3166
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:37,599
huge window now for gaming Gladiator to

3167
02:12:37,599 --> 02:12:39,639
try and end this one they had the bodies

3168
02:12:39,639 --> 02:12:42,320
Dao solo killed the egg he just full

3169
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:46,199
commits onto it no Shiro here that's got

3170
02:12:46,199 --> 02:12:47,800
to be it I mean they can just push the

3171
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:49,559
the two most important heroes are G

3172
02:12:49,559 --> 02:12:51,320
nothing to say we'll be back in 20

3173
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:53,360
seconds 20 seconds and buyback will be

3174
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:56,040
there for the spirit breaker but no Luna

3175
02:12:56,040 --> 02:12:57,520
for the defense they at least have one

3176
02:12:57,520 --> 02:12:58,920
of the extra eggs still up with that

3177
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:00,320
buyback from the Phoenix since he did

3178
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:02,840
just die on the first go gaming just

3179
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:05,000
throw bodies in and

3180
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:08,400
Quinn I mean can they hold it's not easy

3181
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:11,679
without shirro he's all the

3182
02:13:13,079 --> 02:13:15,000
damage they're going for the magas

3183
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,559
they're playing it safe here just in

3184
02:13:17,559 --> 02:13:19,960
case nothing to say the buyback

3185
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:21,520
available

3186
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:23,400
there will be a 4v5 at the least here

3187
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:25,719
for the

3188
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:30,760
defense the r gone building dropping

3189
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:32,520
Spirit breaker buyback but still 60

3190
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:35,719
seconds no shirou

3191
02:13:36,199 --> 02:13:38,360
lgd nothing to say trying to start off

3192
02:13:38,360 --> 02:13:40,199
the defense jump foring you in with the

3193
02:13:40,199 --> 02:13:42,239
straight away onwards Dao Dao stepping

3194
02:13:42,239 --> 02:13:44,040
away's able to put the bkb off for

3195
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:45,960
nothing to say bashing in on towards H

3196
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:48,320
bring it h down low the super NOA pop

3197
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:50,760
successfully but the building second

3198
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:53,040
round taken the base exposed they've got

3199
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:54,760
to do something crazy here lgd if they

3200
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:56,679
want to hold Dao being careful 10

3201
02:13:56,679 --> 02:13:58,119
seconds for chemical range he's letting

3202
02:13:58,119 --> 02:13:59,559
Quinn just hit the throne they're doing

3203
02:13:59,559 --> 02:14:00,800
it safely they're doing it carefully

3204
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:02,040
here gaming Gladiators another charge

3205
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:03,320
for for nothing to say trying his best

3206
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:04,639
to tank the Spells load to throw out

3207
02:14:04,639 --> 02:14:07,679
upon Him reflectly AOL blade from Dao

3208
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:09,559
celer trying to hit onto the ancient

3209
02:14:09,559 --> 02:14:11,760
himself 20 seconds they've got the

3210
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:14,000
fortification lgd doing their best

3211
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,320
Holding Out for a Shero here but he may

3212
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,760
not respawn today as he's dead for 15

3213
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:21,199
more seconds

3214
02:14:21,199 --> 02:14:23,360
the ancient 10 seconds until the Lun is

3215
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:25,239
up nothing to say tried it but it stop

3216
02:14:25,239 --> 02:14:27,559
to it all he's with the H stop he's got

3217
02:14:27,559 --> 02:14:29,480
the two of them he gets the jump the bur

3218
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:32,480
over buto he's dead K him it doesn't

3219
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:35,960
matter the ace finishes off the Agent P

3220
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:38,440
is called gaming Gladiators will take

3221
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:41,679
this game one I what a team fight up top

3222
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:43,159
beautiful stuff from gaming Gladiator

3223
02:14:43,159 --> 02:14:44,880
just having the confidence to just walk

3224
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:46,760
in there and take out nothing to say I

3225
02:14:46,760 --> 02:14:48,199
mean throwing everything onto him he

3226
02:14:48,199 --> 02:14:50,559
feels so tanky he's got bulldo he's got

3227
02:14:50,559 --> 02:14:52,119
all this capabilities to try to protect

3228
02:14:52,119 --> 02:14:53,960
himself but they still burst him through

3229
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:56,559
it and somehow Dao solo kills the egg

3230
02:14:56,559 --> 02:14:58,840
when it means everything wow I'm been in

3231
02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:01,000
an insane final push and a close push as

3232
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,360
well you know if there was sort of

3233
02:15:02,360 --> 02:15:04,599
anything like a 10c less on that cool

3234
02:15:04,599 --> 02:15:06,719
down of the the buyback of Shir if he

3235
02:15:06,719 --> 02:15:08,079
was able to turn up for that defense

3236
02:15:08,079 --> 02:15:10,079
maybe they could have held but as it was

3237
02:15:10,079 --> 02:15:12,400
Gladiators realizing that they had this

3238
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:15,119
window to go all in to end the game

3239
02:15:15,119 --> 02:15:16,960
before Sher was able to do anything with

3240
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:18,599
the rap here pickup I mean look at these

3241
02:15:18,599 --> 02:15:20,159
damage numbers in particular Quinn doing

3242
02:15:20,159 --> 02:15:22,520
about 60 th damage this game the next

3243
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:24,760
highest on his team daa with like 27

3244
02:15:24,760 --> 02:15:26,559
Shiro also of course carrying heavily

3245
02:15:26,559 --> 02:15:29,040
inside that later stage is 52k damage

3246
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:31,599
but overall gaming this necro pick

3247
02:15:31,599 --> 02:15:33,360
seemed to be pretty perfect for Quinn to

3248
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:34,960
take over I think it certainly did

3249
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:37,040
either way an insane opening here to

3250
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:38,960
this final day of the international both

3251
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:40,960
teams absolutely playing their hearts

3252
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:43,440
out but as it is gaming Gladiators they

3253
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:46,880
will close up and take this game

3254
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:50,599
one a phenomenal showing for this first

3255
02:15:50,599 --> 02:15:53,159
game I really thought lgd had that

3256
02:15:53,159 --> 02:15:54,559
middle part of the game that they were

3257
02:15:54,559 --> 02:15:56,199
going to be able to close it down that

3258
02:15:56,199 --> 02:15:58,639
lunar illusion taking a lot of doing a

3259
02:15:58,639 --> 02:16:00,280
lot of damage to the racks but

3260
02:16:00,280 --> 02:16:03,079
ultimately that third Ro fight was the

3261
02:16:03,079 --> 02:16:06,199
game changer Gunner yeah and it looked

3262
02:16:06,199 --> 02:16:08,000
like they had it for a second the Luna

3263
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,719
Shard just was doing so much damage but

3264
02:16:09,719 --> 02:16:11,320
I think nothing to say dying at the

3265
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:12,599
start of the fight really hurt them he

3266
02:16:12,599 --> 02:16:14,000
wasn't able to protect the egg which is

3267
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,760
really important for kind of their

3268
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:17,559
success also uh there was an

3269
02:16:17,559 --> 02:16:19,040
uncharacteristic mistake I think from

3270
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:20,520
Gaming With The High Ground push I was

3271
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:21,840
really surprised surprised cuz they're

3272
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:23,000
probably the best team at this early

3273
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
game High Ground siage they know when to

3274
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:26,400
do it they know how to do it without

3275
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:28,599
dying but in this game after they had

3276
02:16:28,599 --> 02:16:30,239
this really nice early game lead they

3277
02:16:30,239 --> 02:16:32,319
kind of threw it away a little yeah they

3278
02:16:32,319 --> 02:16:34,120
didn't have the best Lanes this game but

3279
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:35,960
they they managed to come strong but uh

3280
02:16:35,960 --> 02:16:37,439
like I want to talk about like how they

3281
02:16:37,439 --> 02:16:40,080
manag to take that mid game lead with

3282
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:41,639
the rotations of the supports because

3283
02:16:41,639 --> 02:16:43,840
they play so well with the ccnc that

3284
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:45,760
they managed to like make an even game

3285
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:47,880
to look like insanely one-sided right

3286
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:49,120
and they were pushing for a long time

3287
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:50,920
they were pressuring them of course they

3288
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:53,319
few s sleep UPS on The High Ground but I

3289
02:16:53,319 --> 02:16:55,160
mean the fights the fights around this

3290
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:57,040
Rush pits like they were they were

3291
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:59,080
deciding and I think on the last fight

3292
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:01,519
lgd had had an opportunity to jump them

3293
02:17:01,519 --> 02:17:03,200
first when they saw them on the on the

3294
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:04,479
board but they decided to go for The

3295
02:17:04,479 --> 02:17:06,719
Rush pit instead and like it was like

3296
02:17:06,719 --> 02:17:10,439
very um the last position there in my

3297
02:17:10,439 --> 02:17:12,359
opinion having a look at some of the

3298
02:17:12,359 --> 02:17:14,399
reactions there from not only the

3299
02:17:14,399 --> 02:17:16,000
players but also their supporting

3300
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:19,280
members too uh this game wasn't clean At

3301
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:21,160
All by any means for G like we've

3302
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:22,399
already pointed out The High Ground

3303
02:17:22,399 --> 02:17:24,280
issues that they had but what exactly

3304
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:26,760
were lgd able to do sheep to be able to

3305
02:17:26,760 --> 02:17:28,519
capitalize on those poor High Ground

3306
02:17:28,519 --> 02:17:30,800
pushes and make it so difficult for G I

3307
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:31,960
think it was more than just The High

3308
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:33,479
Ground pushes but just like a little bit

3309
02:17:33,479 --> 02:17:35,040
of sloppiness and lack of discipline

3310
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:37,120
from G in general like for example when

3311
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:39,319
they smoked into the triangle to try and

3312
02:17:39,319 --> 02:17:41,160
uh disrupt Luna get a kill there the

3313
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:42,840
fact that they overcommitted and dived

3314
02:17:42,840 --> 02:17:44,960
and threw away the lives of four Heroes

3315
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:46,439
when they had like it was close to like

3316
02:17:46,439 --> 02:17:48,399
5 or 6K leads so early on like that was

3317
02:17:48,399 --> 02:17:49,639
kind of where they could Stomp and end

3318
02:17:49,639 --> 02:17:50,960
the game and instead they kind of of

3319
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:53,120
threw it away and I think that was like

3320
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:56,200
a massive moment for them um otherwise

3321
02:17:56,200 --> 02:17:57,479
like I think they did a really good job

3322
02:17:57,479 --> 02:17:59,559
getting to that place in the in the

3323
02:17:59,559 --> 02:18:02,120
first place the fact that this fast

3324
02:18:02,120 --> 02:18:03,719
boots of travel on necro allow them to

3325
02:18:03,719 --> 02:18:05,200
be everywhere on the map I think Ace

3326
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:07,000
usually he plays incredibly greedy but

3327
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,800
this game he was way more sacrificial he

3328
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:10,200
was way lower on the net worth he was

3329
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:11,760
super hyperactive with his supports

3330
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:14,120
playing around making moves I also want

3331
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:15,639
to talk about item builds because when

3332
02:18:15,639 --> 02:18:17,080
you're playing against lineup like this

3333
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:18,559
on the gamings like they have three

3334
02:18:18,559 --> 02:18:20,160
Heroes that build like you know two

3335
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:22,519
Heroes have hard s Alchemist is insane

3336
02:18:22,519 --> 02:18:25,519
in HP region and on the side of lgd they

3337
02:18:25,519 --> 02:18:27,880
didn't have like they didn't have shivas

3338
02:18:27,880 --> 02:18:29,280
did you guys see that he went to go for

3339
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:31,319
the fist pump on Quinn and Quinn just

3340
02:18:31,319 --> 02:18:33,439
stood up and walked away oh that

3341
02:18:33,439 --> 02:18:36,439
happened to me many times it's all right

3342
02:18:36,439 --> 02:18:38,639
still there's a game too he's got to get

3343
02:18:38,639 --> 02:18:40,319
back in the zone but yeah the item

3344
02:18:40,319 --> 02:18:42,040
builds like you need to have shivas you

3345
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:43,760
need to have vessel against a lineup

3346
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:45,240
like this and if you don't have then

3347
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:46,519
we've seen so many fights when they

3348
02:18:46,519 --> 02:18:48,080
start and like the fight look good in

3349
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:49,840
the beginning but then they go out the

3350
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:51,559
region and then they go back and this is

3351
02:18:51,559 --> 02:18:54,000
like how they lost many fights I was a

3352
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,559
little bit worried about the AL we've

3353
02:18:55,559 --> 02:18:57,080
just seen him be quite tumultuous

3354
02:18:57,080 --> 02:18:58,519
throughout this event he's had some

3355
02:18:58,519 --> 02:18:59,719
really good showing some really rough

3356
02:18:59,719 --> 02:19:01,319
ones and that mid game was where I

3357
02:19:01,319 --> 02:19:04,120
worried about if the Doro Al was going

3358
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:06,080
to be able to carry it obviously we see

3359
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:08,639
it it was able to in this way but what

3360
02:19:08,639 --> 02:19:10,960
else about the AL meant that that late

3361
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:12,280
game was kind of difficult that he

3362
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:14,000
wasn't really hitting the the timings

3363
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,880
who couldn't be together as much with

3364
02:19:15,880 --> 02:19:16,719
gaming

3365
02:19:16,719 --> 02:19:18,840
Gladiators uh the biggest thing with Al

3366
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:20,040
is you generally want this really fast

3367
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:21,719
early game timing which is always what

3368
02:19:21,719 --> 02:19:24,559
gaming goes for so I think the AL looked

3369
02:19:24,559 --> 02:19:25,800
really good up until The High Ground

3370
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:27,160
push and then after that it kind of just

3371
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:29,160
ended up being a little scary cuz he'll

3372
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:30,519
get outscaled by the lunar really

3373
02:19:30,519 --> 02:19:32,519
quickly and I think they threw their

3374
02:19:32,519 --> 02:19:34,399
gold lead up to around only four or 5K

3375
02:19:34,399 --> 02:19:35,679
gold and when you have an Al it's always

3376
02:19:35,679 --> 02:19:37,800
just fake so it started to look a little

3377
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:39,120
scary but I think just the power of

3378
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:41,000
necros in this draft was it kind of

3379
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:42,319
showed also Primal Beast with like they

3380
02:19:42,319 --> 02:19:44,080
have double Hearts I think heart there

3381
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:45,920
was none on lgd if I'm not mistaken

3382
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:48,200
maybe the center had one but I just

3383
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:50,120
think that having more Health than the

3384
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:51,920
other guys just matter so much right now

3385
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:53,600
it's all about being tanky we're going

3386
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:55,800
to see some uh more breakdowns of this

3387
02:19:55,800 --> 02:19:59,319
game number one purge has all the

3388
02:19:59,319 --> 02:20:01,200
information thank you Nat yeah being

3389
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:03,479
tanky is very important but how you get

3390
02:20:03,479 --> 02:20:04,960
there is by collecting gold and

3391
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:06,040
experience and the way the gaming

3392
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:09,080
Gladiators do it is so so fast compared

3393
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:10,880
to other teams and a lot of this comes

3394
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:13,359
with pressure on the map Quinn here 8

3395
02:20:13,359 --> 02:20:14,760
minutes into the game they just got a

3396
02:20:14,760 --> 02:20:16,800
kill on the spear prer he's constantly

3397
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:18,479
Crossing into the enemy part of the map

3398
02:20:18,479 --> 02:20:20,200
and the you already have an observer W

3399
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:22,280
in this of the Jungle so what he does is

3400
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:24,080
puts himself in an offensive position

3401
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:26,280
but also is stealing Stacks that enemies

3402
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:28,160
made that means he's basically getting

3403
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:30,200
himself more gold while wasting their

3404
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:31,800
time with this move and this

3405
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:33,880
continuously happened the first 15

3406
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:35,560
minutes of the game here's the obvious

3407
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:37,680
Shadow Demon stacking two camps in this

3408
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:39,560
area he kills the watch run which gives

3409
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:41,200
him vision and they come over and kill

3410
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:43,080
him they were just ignoring tier one

3411
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:44,560
Tower the vast majority of this game

3412
02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:46,720
which is not normal instead saying we're

3413
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:49,120
ganking and clearing Stacks easily using

3414
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:51,560
necros who's tanky and has tons of AOE

3415
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:54,040
damage very able to do this uh at this

3416
02:20:54,040 --> 02:20:55,840
stage of game now the invade fail that

3417
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:57,439
happened at the toin Mark was a little

3418
02:20:57,439 --> 02:20:59,840
bad for them this AOE here this ink

3419
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:01,800
swell around the Primal Beast if Luna

3420
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:04,080
gets within this range she gets stunned

3421
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:05,760
and probably comboed she interrupts the

3422
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:07,359
first stun Stampy keeps are slightly

3423
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:08,760
outside of that range and that's why

3424
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:10,240
they were able to disengage and win that

3425
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:11,920
huge fight against gladiators but what

3426
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:13,240
did they do immediately after they

3427
02:21:13,240 --> 02:21:15,560
respawned they went back to the same

3428
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:17,960
spot they do not want to let them clear

3429
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:19,399
these Stacks easily they want to get

3430
02:21:19,399 --> 02:21:21,040
kills they want to accelerate to Gold

3431
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:22,560
advantage and this all helps them

3432
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:24,479
accelerate their timing so they win this

3433
02:21:24,479 --> 02:21:26,720
fight and Dao rotates over with his

3434
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:28,560
Radiance to clear this ancient stack

3435
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:31,359
taking away from uh Luna and all of this

3436
02:21:31,359 --> 02:21:32,960
acceleration that they work for hits him

3437
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:35,160
with this crazy timing at 16 minutes bkb

3438
02:21:35,160 --> 02:21:37,520
finished on Alchemist the whole team is

3439
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:39,600
already set up to prep this fight and it

3440
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:41,319
ends up going well for gaming Gladiators

3441
02:21:41,319 --> 02:21:42,800
this is why they're able to Rack so

3442
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:45,280
early cuz they're invading constantly in

3443
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:47,600
slightly abnormal ways and winning great

3444
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:49,520
fights it was a very very close game

3445
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:52,040
though it was a really close one that

3446
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:53,920
early game we've already said it many

3447
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:55,840
times you said it Reser lgd sometimes

3448
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:57,240
struggle with the laning face gaming

3449
02:21:57,240 --> 02:21:59,240
Gladiators they love the tempo they love

3450
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:01,120
to be aggressive for themselves everyone

3451
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:03,840
in this Arena they loved the game one

3452
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:06,000
and it's nice to know that we still have

3453
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,120
at least one more game in this best of

3454
02:22:08,120 --> 02:22:10,000
three to be able to see some more action

3455
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,319
just like that but it's not only people

3456
02:22:12,319 --> 02:22:15,840
in this Arena that are enjoying ti2

3457
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:18,800
there are locations all across the world

3458
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:21,200
right now that are enjoying the action

3459
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:24,120
that is taking place here so game

3460
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:27,359
Gladiator fans lgd fans they spend all

3461
02:22:27,359 --> 02:22:28,800
the way across the world not just here

3462
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:31,120
guys yeah and the game is amazing like

3463
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:33,560
you know you you you you expect this

3464
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:35,120
game to be like over soon because of the

3465
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:37,720
high lead of the gaming g they they had

3466
02:22:37,720 --> 02:22:40,040
but at the same time like it's just like

3467
02:22:40,040 --> 02:22:41,840
very back and forth in those team fights

3468
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:43,439
like they very little gimmicks that

3469
02:22:43,439 --> 02:22:45,000
decide that who's going to win the game

3470
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,880
you know it's it's not clear until the

3471
02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:49,439
very end yeah we talked a lot about how

3472
02:22:49,439 --> 02:22:50,800
gaming maybe made a mistake on The High

3473
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:52,280
Ground push but I think lgd the way they

3474
02:22:52,280 --> 02:22:53,520
played the mid game from behind was

3475
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:55,560
really commendable they actually came

3476
02:22:55,560 --> 02:22:56,760
back into the game at some points they

3477
02:22:56,760 --> 02:22:58,600
had a Rapier timing on this Aegis and it

3478
02:22:58,600 --> 02:23:00,240
was just unfortunate that the contest on

3479
02:23:00,240 --> 02:23:01,680
the RO fight didn't work out cuz he

3480
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:02,840
ended the game with a Rapier in his

3481
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:04,160
inventory he was just dead for 2 minutes

3482
02:23:04,160 --> 02:23:06,600
so he couldn't use it and so in the next

3483
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:08,120
game I'm probably looking for their

3484
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:09,600
Lanes to go slightly better in the draft

3485
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:11,560
I think maybe the necro ban is probably

3486
02:23:11,560 --> 02:23:13,080
something they should look towards cuz

3487
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:14,279
it seems like the hero pool they won for

3488
02:23:14,279 --> 02:23:15,439
nothing to say is not really going to

3489
02:23:15,439 --> 02:23:17,160
work out versus Quinn at least if he

3490
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:19,439
gets the necro um but overall I think

3491
02:23:19,439 --> 02:23:20,880
the way that they're playing is honestly

3492
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:22,200
pretty stable versus gaming Gladiators

3493
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:24,040
if they can kind of fix some of the big

3494
02:23:24,040 --> 02:23:26,279
major mistakes in the draft I think

3495
02:23:26,279 --> 02:23:28,240
they'll be kind of set for the next game

3496
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:30,240
all right well let's see where the crowd

3497
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:32,439
is sitting if they gaming Gladiator fans

3498
02:23:32,439 --> 02:23:34,640
if they're lgd fans if they're hoping

3499
02:23:34,640 --> 02:23:37,439

02:25:21,319 --> 02:25:23,120
going for for game number two do you

3533
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:24,960
believe in the comeback from lgd that

3534
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:26,560
they're going to face team spirit again

3535
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:28,200
in the grand finals who whoa whoa we're

3536
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:31,880
not biased panelists we are very okay I

3537
02:25:31,880 --> 02:25:34,000
very biased like even like if they

3538
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,439
manage to win this game like with this

3539
02:25:36,439 --> 02:25:38,319
you know back and forth you know

3540
02:25:38,319 --> 02:25:40,399
happening in the game for gam I don't

3541
02:25:40,399 --> 02:25:41,640
think like the next game is going to

3542
02:25:41,640 --> 02:25:43,279
look any different like if if they get

3543
02:25:43,279 --> 02:25:44,920
their lineup with the you know pushes

3544
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:46,560
and like how they can take down the

3545
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:48,520
towers early on even earlier than this

3546
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:50,479
game I think it's going to be like super

3547
02:25:50,479 --> 02:25:52,439
easy super one-sided okay you guys might

3548
02:25:52,439 --> 02:25:54,920
not be uh biased but maybe I can win you

3549
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:56,920
over because we do have a listen in we

3550
02:25:56,920 --> 02:25:58,840
have inside the pods for game in the

3551
02:25:58,840 --> 02:26:02,319
Gladiators during that game

3552
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:06,080
one but it doesn't matter I think we

3553
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:07,640
just want to fight this Ro I don't

3554
02:26:07,640 --> 02:26:09,279
need this objectives just want a

3555
02:26:09,279 --> 02:26:13,000
straight fight head to

3556
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:16,640
hit did did convince you they just want

3557
02:26:16,640 --> 02:26:19,439
to fight yeah very calm yeah want they

3558
02:26:19,439 --> 02:26:21,279
they calm and all they want to do is

3559
02:26:21,279 --> 02:26:22,960
just uh take fights they don't care

3560
02:26:22,960 --> 02:26:24,120
about objectives they don't care about

3561
02:26:24,120 --> 02:26:26,359
buildings or Ro or anything like that

3562
02:26:26,359 --> 02:26:27,720
just make sure you're killing the enemy

3563
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:30,200
Heroes just kill them twice yeah I mean

3564
02:26:30,200 --> 02:26:32,479
I'm biased for a game three so okay so

3565
02:26:32,479 --> 02:26:33,920
you I have to ref for lgd this game just

3566
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:35,960
for a game three cuz I think you know

3567
02:26:35,960 --> 02:26:37,920
more games today the marrier yeah for

3568
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:39,479
sure it's it's our final day so we want

3569
02:26:39,479 --> 02:26:41,600
to see everything go the distance I

3570
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:44,359
completely agree it's also like the

3571
02:26:44,359 --> 02:26:46,160
level of DOTA now is just like so

3572
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:48,720
unbelievably High when it gets really

3573
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:50,479
close like when we see these 78 minute

3574
02:26:50,479 --> 02:26:52,000
game we're getting all the tier five

3575
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,120
items out that's the hype that's the

3576
02:26:54,120 --> 02:26:56,040
stuff I want to see today I want to go

3577
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:57,279
the distance you wanted to go the

3578
02:26:57,279 --> 02:26:59,319
distance you 17 plus of minute games you

3579
02:26:59,319 --> 02:27:01,040
want three games in this best of three

3580
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:02,960
well game two it's still a little bit

3581
02:27:02,960 --> 02:27:04,479
away but we can talk about some change

3582
02:27:04,479 --> 02:27:06,359
ups that necro is a focus that you guys

3583
02:27:06,359 --> 02:27:07,960
talked about but then I wonder what

3584
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:09,200
you're willing to let through are you

3585
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:10,680
willing to let through a bristle A

3586
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:13,200
Dazzle the Chen the ench on the side of

3587
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:15,840
lgd for gaming Gladiators to pick up I

3588
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:16,920
think it's hard to make an argument for

3589
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:18,760
Chen or en just because they both fill

3590
02:27:18,760 --> 02:27:20,359
the same role so if you ban one it's

3591
02:27:20,359 --> 02:27:22,279
kind of forced to ban both otherwise

3592
02:27:22,279 --> 02:27:24,080
there's no point so it ends up being

3593
02:27:24,080 --> 02:27:25,240
they have to choose between Dazzle or

3594
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:27,600
bristle if they want to ban the necro

3595
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:29,680
and I think gaming has shown for both

3596
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:31,279
Heroes that it's really really scary to

3597
02:27:31,279 --> 02:27:33,840
deal with and I think as as of now

3598
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:35,439
Bristol probably has people are more

3599
02:27:35,439 --> 02:27:36,840
used to playing vers it than the Dazzle

3600
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:38,439
especially because Dazzle is a flex hero

3601
02:27:38,439 --> 02:27:41,040
it goes mid it goes off lane for gaming

3602
02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:42,560
but the Bristol's kind of always off

3603
02:27:42,560 --> 02:27:44,040
Lane so you'll know you go in the draft

3604
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:45,080
knowing what's going to happen and you

3605
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:46,840
kind of at least can have a plan walking

3606
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:49,600
into it I imagine this time lgd will

3607
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:51,640
have first pick as well since this game

3608
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:53,319
to which gives them the advantage cuz

3609
02:27:53,319 --> 02:27:54,760
last game obviously the necro came out

3610
02:27:54,760 --> 02:27:56,240
at the end of second phase where they

3611
02:27:56,240 --> 02:27:58,399
got to just like counter their Lane and

3612
02:27:58,399 --> 02:28:00,200
have a really good moment for the necro

3613
02:28:00,200 --> 02:28:02,200
so they shouldn't have that this time so

3614
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:04,399
I'm not sure if they need to like ban it

3615
02:28:04,399 --> 02:28:05,720
I mean if anything they could change the

3616
02:28:05,720 --> 02:28:07,319
life steer band to necro band right in

3617
02:28:07,319 --> 02:28:09,120
the second phase I think it's important

3618
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:10,880
but I do think that that there's two

3619
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:12,560
topics that they need to like discuss

3620
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:14,399
within the team first is like how to

3621
02:28:14,399 --> 02:28:15,960
prevent those rotations from supports

3622
02:28:15,960 --> 02:28:17,399
and like protecting your mid lane

3623
02:28:17,399 --> 02:28:18,880
because this is where you know gaming

3624
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:20,439
lad is start to pressure and your super

3625
02:28:20,439 --> 02:28:22,080
hard and the second thing is about item

3626
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:23,479
builds if you're playing against lineup

3627
02:28:23,479 --> 02:28:25,200
that has a lot of region like you need

3628
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:27,040
to have vessel you need to have shivas

3629
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:28,319
you need to have some way to deal with

3630
02:28:28,319 --> 02:28:30,399
it look G I'm going to ask a question

3631
02:28:30,399 --> 02:28:31,560
you can tell me no you don't have to

3632
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:33,080
answer but you were in this position you

3633
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:34,520
were on the main stage and you were

3634
02:28:34,520 --> 02:28:36,120
facing up against gaming Gladiators you

3635
02:28:36,120 --> 02:28:38,120
guys lost game one what was that 15

3636
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:39,760
minutes for you spent like to look

3637
02:28:39,760 --> 02:28:42,240
towards game two what was your focus and

3638
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:43,520
what did you just kind of have to push

3639
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:45,560
to the side and ignore it was a lot

3640
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:48,080
about we talked a lot about the Chen

3641
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:50,359
which is kind of the guys that to try to

3642
02:28:50,359 --> 02:28:51,600
end the game really fast and we need to

3643
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:53,399
find a way to deal with it and we didn't

3644
02:28:53,399 --> 02:28:55,680
find the solution in time and so it's

3645
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:57,439
time to see if lgd can find the solution

3646
02:28:57,439 --> 02:28:59,200
in time all right well the players are

3647
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:01,040
walking out now they're going to be

3648
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:03,560
taking the stage maybe for the last time

3649
02:29:03,560 --> 02:29:05,240
for lgd maybe there's going to be a

3650
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:06,840
little bit more in it we don't really

3651
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:11,040
know but we do want to know more about

3652
02:29:12,680 --> 02:29:16,359
lgd you just put carrye mag and throw

3653
02:29:16,359 --> 02:29:19,399
Len M or what 10 seconds remaining have

3654
02:29:19,399 --> 02:29:21,359
to see here I do know for a fact that

3655
02:29:21,359 --> 02:29:23,319
we've seen some interesting heroes from

3656
02:29:23,319 --> 02:29:25,399
shirou well they're going to put the

3657
02:29:25,399 --> 02:29:27,120
skyth wait are they going to put the

3658
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:30,080
skyth mid I I believe that's I think

3659
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:33,319
that's Kota Willow it's Willow

3660
02:29:33,319 --> 02:29:37,439
did Willow

3661
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:51,640
wow carry dark Willow yeah what in God's

3662
02:29:51,640 --> 02:29:54,319
Grand earthart is

3663
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:15,800
this this is why LG has so many fans

3664
02:30:15,800 --> 02:30:17,319
because every time you think you've got

3665
02:30:17,319 --> 02:30:18,840
this team figured out on how they want

3666
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:22,960

two G Gladiator game two of our lower

3683
02:32:06,399 --> 02:32:08,439
bracket finals we just heard it there

3684
02:32:08,439 --> 02:32:11,560
from why Innovation is a confidence this

3685
02:32:11,560 --> 02:32:13,479
team they've been known for those wild

3686
02:32:13,479 --> 02:32:15,080
drafts they were the first ones to do

3687
02:32:15,080 --> 02:32:17,160
dark Willow on the main stage we saw it

3688
02:32:17,160 --> 02:32:19,640
last weekend this could be the do or die

3689
02:32:19,640 --> 02:32:21,200
this is where the Innovation is really

3690
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:23,279
going to come in clutch for them how far

3691
02:32:23,279 --> 02:32:25,279
do you push the envelope to make it to

3692
02:32:25,279 --> 02:32:27,479
the Grand finals to make a comeback in

3693
02:32:27,479 --> 02:32:30,399
this low bracket to me it's definitely

3694
02:32:30,399 --> 02:32:32,800
it was their best draft with dark Willow

3695
02:32:32,800 --> 02:32:34,840
and BR Mo and Magnus and I would love to

3696
02:32:34,840 --> 02:32:36,880
see them going for this again because I

3697
02:32:36,880 --> 02:32:38,600
think this is like the way to break the

3698
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:40,840
game against gaming glus and they to

3699
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:43,120
pull something that they don't expect

3700
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:45,120
and it will break their plan of like you

3701
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:48,040
know having the stable mid mid game I

3702
02:32:48,040 --> 02:32:49,359
definitely hope they don't take the

3703
02:32:49,359 --> 02:32:51,399
carry do Willow I think the rest is good

3704
02:32:51,399 --> 02:32:53,359
but if you remember that game I think

3705
02:32:53,359 --> 02:32:54,800
the willow took a really long time to

3706
02:32:54,800 --> 02:32:55,960
come online if you're playing against

3707
02:32:55,960 --> 02:32:57,600
Gman who want to press you so early I

3708
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:59,960
don't think you can be one hero down in

3709
02:32:59,960 --> 02:33:01,680
the way they were for so long like she

3710
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:03,680
just needs so many items to come online

3711
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:04,960
and it really was a case of like the

3712
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:06,479
rest of the lgd team really like

3713
02:33:06,479 --> 02:33:08,040
carrying the game to the point where

3714
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:09,880
shirro could take po yeah cuz the big

3715
02:33:09,880 --> 02:33:11,520
timing on level is level 20 for dark

3716
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:12,600
Willow carry it's when you get the more

3717
02:33:12,600 --> 02:33:15,279
duration on the W so a lot of the time

3718
02:33:15,279 --> 02:33:16,439
when you talk about the her like we're

3719
02:33:16,439 --> 02:33:18,439
playing for the level 20 Team guys and

3720
02:33:18,439 --> 02:33:20,000
uh if you're playing for level 20 for

3721
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,279
gaming Gladiators you might be in for a

3722
02:33:21,279 --> 02:33:23,920
struggle so good news is it looks like

3723
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:25,840
lgd is first pick so that means that

3724
02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:27,240
they have the opportunity to ban the

3725
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:29,080
Chen and the end and then they can take

3726
02:33:29,080 --> 02:33:31,319
whatever they want in the draft so I'm

3727
02:33:31,319 --> 02:33:33,160
I'll be interested to to see how the

3728
02:33:33,160 --> 02:33:34,920
draft changed it up this time I'm mostly

3729
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:36,439
talking about like how they can take a

3730
02:33:36,439 --> 02:33:39,960
lead and like pressure uh GG themselves

3731
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:41,200
because this BR mother had an

3732
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:42,960
opportunity you know to to pressure

3733
02:33:42,960 --> 02:33:45,040
their towers and to create a lot of

3734
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:47,040
chaos and I think this this is what they

3735
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:49,000
should be aiming for not dark specific

3736
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,720
but something unique

3737
02:33:51,800 --> 02:33:53,720
lgd had first pick they're still

3738
02:33:53,720 --> 02:33:55,319
focusing on that Dazzle that Chan

3739
02:33:55,319 --> 02:33:56,520
enchantress like you said Gunner if

3740
02:33:56,520 --> 02:33:58,000
you're going to take one out take both

3741
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,840
of them out so that's their three bands

3742
02:33:59,840 --> 02:34:02,800
and it opens up the Mora for them to to

3743
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:04,680
be able to get their hands on the cool

3744
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:06,560
thing about the Mora is we were talking

3745
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:09,160
about the necros and so thankfully if

3746
02:34:09,160 --> 02:34:10,960
Mor ends up being a carry she she's

3747
02:34:10,960 --> 02:34:12,319
really good cuz she can shoot him no

3748
02:34:12,319 --> 02:34:14,000
matter what if he's ghost shouted so

3749
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:15,439
it's kind of already like a soft counter

3750
02:34:15,439 --> 02:34:17,399
to the necro later in the draft and it's

3751
02:34:17,399 --> 02:34:18,720
also I think it's one of the better

3752
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:20,399
carriers versus chaos kn he can't burst

3753
02:34:20,399 --> 02:34:21,600
you during your old so you have kind of

3754
02:34:21,600 --> 02:34:24,279
a way to fight around him yeah I've seen

3755
02:34:24,279 --> 02:34:26,560
this match up go both ways obviously

3756
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:29,399
because mu is very uh dependent on her

3757
02:34:29,399 --> 02:34:31,279
positioning in fights and Chaos Knight

3758
02:34:31,279 --> 02:34:32,800
usually goes for this like silver Ed and

3759
02:34:32,800 --> 02:34:34,479
stuff he's going to be seeking her out

3760
02:34:34,479 --> 02:34:36,359
if they do find her it mean the bus is

3761
02:34:36,359 --> 02:34:38,040
insane what is quite squishy without her

3762
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:40,680
all um and Chaos Knight in general just

3763
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:42,359
this this patch is is so strong his

3764
02:34:42,359 --> 02:34:44,479
laning is terrifying like I I wonderful

3765
02:34:44,479 --> 02:34:45,880
see grimstroke contested again going

3766
02:34:45,880 --> 02:34:47,600
into the second

3767
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:50,359
phase b boom had the flex with chaos

3768
02:34:50,359 --> 02:34:52,279
Knight yesterday we saw it it was able

3769
02:34:52,279 --> 02:34:54,279
to go to carry off lane for themselves

3770
02:34:54,279 --> 02:34:55,720
is that the same for gaming Gladiators

3771
02:34:55,720 --> 02:34:58,439
or this is very much a Daio they're okay

3772
02:34:58,439 --> 02:35:00,880
with uh if this hero is attempted to be

3773
02:35:00,880 --> 02:35:02,479
counted that Dau can still have a really

3774
02:35:02,479 --> 02:35:04,080
good game for himself and he'll be able

3775
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:05,479
to come back into do it I think it's

3776
02:35:05,479 --> 02:35:07,439
most the heroes for daa because it's

3777
02:35:07,439 --> 02:35:09,240
already very strong Lane and it's the

3778
02:35:09,240 --> 02:35:11,520
hero he excels and it's very aggressive

3779
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:13,800
as well and it allows celery to pick

3780
02:35:13,800 --> 02:35:16,680
Heroes that are not really uh needed for

3781
02:35:16,680 --> 02:35:18,520
the lane because it's already like very

3782
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:21,040
self sustainable so he can do his things

3783
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:22,479
with itself T and like run around mid

3784
02:35:22,479 --> 02:35:24,279
lane help

3785
02:35:24,279 --> 02:35:27,200
Queen so something I'm interested in is

3786
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:29,439
nagaon I think this hero is pretty

3787
02:35:29,439 --> 02:35:30,760
strong and she's really good versus

3788
02:35:30,760 --> 02:35:32,279
chaos Knight either in a lane match up

3789
02:35:32,279 --> 02:35:34,160
or just in the game as a carry to carry

3790
02:35:34,160 --> 02:35:35,680
she her Illusions pretty much do the

3791
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:37,000
same thing as K Knights where K Knight

3792
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:38,279
will just use his ult to push out all

3793
02:35:38,279 --> 02:35:39,960
the lanes the whole game and N get has

3794
02:35:39,960 --> 02:35:41,240
that for free with a much lower cool

3795
02:35:41,240 --> 02:35:42,880
down so she's always ready to fight she

3796
02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:44,760
can use song to disengage from the chaos

3797
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:47,560
KN and they also ban The Brew uh for the

3798
02:35:47,560 --> 02:35:49,399
side of gaming so if I was lgd I'd

3799
02:35:49,399 --> 02:35:50,800
probably be looking at a Naga at some

3800
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:52,560
point in this

3801
02:35:52,560 --> 02:35:54,840
draft and I'm sure GJ is looking for

3802
02:35:54,840 --> 02:35:56,640
another La Droid game I think it will

3803
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:58,160
fit their lineup very

3804
02:35:58,160 --> 02:36:00,000
well they want to keep picking their

3805
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:01,640
comfort it's gone them this far it'll

3806
02:36:01,640 --> 02:36:03,399
keep you know keep them going so I don't

3807
02:36:03,399 --> 02:36:05,200
think gaming really feels like they have

3808
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:07,160
the need to change anything if they get

3809
02:36:07,160 --> 02:36:08,200
you know one to two of they're just

3810
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:09,479
stable Heroes every game and they just

3811
02:36:09,479 --> 02:36:11,319
change the rest around to just fit it I

3812
02:36:11,319 --> 02:36:13,279
think it's kind of their

3813
02:36:13,279 --> 02:36:15,880
formula I was very shocked that maybe

3814
02:36:15,880 --> 02:36:17,040
not very shocked is the right word here

3815
02:36:17,040 --> 02:36:18,920
but I was surprised lgd they went

3816
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:21,000
hardcore on the supports the Phoenix and

3817
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:22,760
the Grim being their ban does still

3818
02:36:22,760 --> 02:36:24,399
leave that dark Willow open for gaming

3819
02:36:24,399 --> 02:36:26,080
Gladiators to pick up but their response

3820
02:36:26,080 --> 02:36:29,520
is Magnus ET yeah I think teams consider

3821
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:31,240
it like one of the counter picks to the

3822
02:36:31,240 --> 02:36:32,960
CK nowadays because it stops the

3823
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:34,720
Illusions and along with the Magnus as

3824
02:36:34,720 --> 02:36:37,439
well you have their aerp and there's

3825
02:36:37,439 --> 02:36:39,720
also like one of the best nothing to say

3826
02:36:39,720 --> 02:36:41,439
Heroes so they're looking pretty good

3827
02:36:41,439 --> 02:36:44,240
already is also one of the first people

3828
02:36:44,240 --> 02:36:45,600
to actually start spamming in pubs a few

3829
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:49,080
weeks ago he I he honestly you know not

3830
02:36:49,080 --> 02:36:50,680
to him up too much but I would say he

3831
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:52,080
probably started the meta in pubs a few

3832
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:53,439
weeks ago just like spamming it off in

3833
02:36:53,439 --> 02:36:55,120
every game and around that same time was

3834
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:56,359
when you know you saw everyone just

3835
02:36:56,359 --> 02:36:58,840
starting to even play a mid but he he's

3836
02:36:58,840 --> 02:37:00,240
also really good on in the off Lane so I

3837
02:37:00,240 --> 02:37:01,200
wouldn't be surprised that they just

3838
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:02,960
have this as a flex pick and if you know

3839
02:37:02,960 --> 02:37:04,240
Quinn tries to counter it right now that

3840
02:37:04,240 --> 02:37:05,279
it can just go to the off lane and be

3841
02:37:05,279 --> 02:37:09,359
comfortable versus chaos Gladiators to

3842
02:37:09,359 --> 02:37:11,640
oh there's another Ace hero that he

3843
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:13,319
excels at I thought they would go for

3844
02:37:13,319 --> 02:37:16,200
the laid but uh R king is also quite

3845
02:37:16,200 --> 02:37:18,640
nice it's very stable very solid they

3846
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:20,359
like to play with the two course in the

3847
02:37:20,359 --> 02:37:23,319
side Lanes so I mean they had it uh

3848
02:37:23,319 --> 02:37:25,359
earlier in this weekend as well and it

3849
02:37:25,359 --> 02:37:26,760
was part of that push trp that they had

3850
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:30,040
those skeletons can be very annoying and

3851
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:32,000
obnoxious I think everything right now

3852
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:33,960
though is leading for nasire and for lgd

3853
02:37:33,960 --> 02:37:35,479
this is looking really scary unless this

3854
02:37:35,479 --> 02:37:36,800
next pick kind of counters it which I

3855
02:37:36,800 --> 02:37:38,279
don't really know what they can pick

3856
02:37:38,279 --> 02:37:41,960
outside of a pugna to prep for it and if

3857
02:37:41,960 --> 02:37:43,800
if lgd get AA I think the draft looks

3858
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:44,880
pretty good for them they'll have a way

3859
02:37:44,880 --> 02:37:46,640
to constantly give vision for the Magnus

3860
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:48,880
ET also gives Vision they have S sleep

3861
02:37:48,880 --> 02:37:51,800
into you know net and sleep play so they

3862
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:53,760
just have a lot of kind of utility with

3863
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:55,760
the Naga across the map I like the Naga

3864
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:57,359
suggestion for sure because it can delay

3865
02:37:57,359 --> 02:37:59,120
the game for them but and I was I was

3866
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:01,000
suggesting this profit yeah I was I was

3867
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,920
see coming and the

3868
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:06,319
N yeah that profit pick was like that

3869
02:38:06,319 --> 02:38:09,520
just made Naga even better yeah so they

3870
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:11,600
take the furion I really like this

3871
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:13,600
versus the strong laning fives like

3872
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:15,279
Elder Titan because what happens is the

3873
02:38:15,279 --> 02:38:16,720
fing goes to your safe Lane and kind of

3874
02:38:16,720 --> 02:38:18,399
exists there and he's always a 3v2 in

3875
02:38:18,399 --> 02:38:20,200
the Top Lane so anytime ET wants to go

3876
02:38:20,200 --> 02:38:22,080
aggressive onto this the you know the

3877
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:24,399
safe Lane theal TP in now it's a 3v2 and

3878
02:38:24,399 --> 02:38:26,399
the ET is not as strong of a hero well

3879
02:38:26,399 --> 02:38:27,880
last time I saw this profit I wasn't

3880
02:38:27,880 --> 02:38:29,600
really big a fan of because it looked

3881
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:31,359
like very squishy during the mid mid

3882
02:38:31,359 --> 02:38:34,000
game but the way GG are playing this is

3883
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:37,359
like this is such a huge Tempo and uh

3884
02:38:37,359 --> 02:38:39,279
you know this Naga like we've seen many

3885
02:38:39,279 --> 02:38:41,600
times already like this this Naga is not

3886
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:43,520
going to be able to come online even

3887
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:44,880
after like you know they're pushing your

3888
02:38:44,880 --> 02:38:47,720
high ground at 20 minutes 10 seconds

3889
02:38:47,720 --> 02:38:49,520
remaining yeah thankfully for Naga one

3890
02:38:49,520 --> 02:38:50,720
of the cool things is the games are

3891
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:52,000
really boring to play when you're the

3892
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,080
other team cuz she just delays it so if

3893
02:38:54,080 --> 02:38:55,760
there's one way to stop gaming from

3894
02:38:55,760 --> 02:38:57,200
pushing your base it's to cut all three

3895
02:38:57,200 --> 02:38:58,960
waves at the same time simultaneously

3896
02:38:58,960 --> 02:39:01,399
and be completely safe cuz you have song

3897
02:39:01,399 --> 02:39:03,160
So Naga is one of the ways that you can

3898
02:39:03,160 --> 02:39:04,359
pretty much delay a game it's kind of

3899
02:39:04,359 --> 02:39:06,120
like a probably more consistent version

3900
02:39:06,120 --> 02:39:07,800
of keeper the light just from the carry

3901
02:39:07,800 --> 02:39:10,279
R so already right now I feel way more

3902
02:39:10,279 --> 02:39:11,840
confident for lgd to take this game into

3903
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:13,080
the mid game to the late game to where

3904
02:39:13,080 --> 02:39:14,920
they're more comfortable taking the win

3905
02:39:14,920 --> 02:39:17,359
dude I'm terrified for for game and like

3906
02:39:17,359 --> 02:39:19,479
how how do you ever take High Ground

3907
02:39:19,479 --> 02:39:21,640
when you're playing into ET stomp you're

3908
02:39:21,640 --> 02:39:23,680
playing into this skewer back you have a

3909
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:25,080
Naga that's going to cut your waves

3910
02:39:25,080 --> 02:39:26,319
while they're holding you off like that

3911
02:39:26,319 --> 02:39:28,439
it seems so difficult to ever breach

3912
02:39:28,439 --> 02:39:29,720
High Ground without just killing the

3913
02:39:29,720 --> 02:39:32,080
entirey of lgd it's so easy when you're

3914
02:39:32,080 --> 02:39:34,680
doing it this early yeah I thought that

3915
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:36,240
too for their previous draft but it

3916
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:38,200
seemed they seem to be make it work you

3917
02:39:38,200 --> 02:39:40,720
know somehow just purely from winning

3918
02:39:40,720 --> 02:39:42,560
lanes and uh making this aggressive

3919
02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:43,960
moves in the mid game and like taking

3920
02:39:43,960 --> 02:39:46,000
complete lead because of how stable

3921
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,200
their mid game is I think as long as

3922
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:50,120
this last pick for lgd either the mid or

3923
02:39:50,120 --> 02:39:53,000
offlane has some sort of wave clear to

3924
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:54,160
deal with the skeletons that are going

3925
02:39:54,160 --> 02:39:55,760
to come and kind of help defend the tier

3926
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:56,880
tws when they're actually sitting there

3927
02:39:56,880 --> 02:39:58,760
in front of you I'll be really happy for

3928
02:39:58,760 --> 02:40:00,399
lgd's draft oh there's no way they

3929
02:40:00,399 --> 02:40:02,680
didn't P Pango and they pick Pango all

3930
02:40:02,680 --> 02:40:04,520
right well there's their wove it gives

3931
02:40:04,520 --> 02:40:05,640
them also a team fight to fight on the

3932
02:40:05,640 --> 02:40:07,399
towers I really like this match for ra

3933
02:40:07,399 --> 02:40:09,040
King you onot the skeletons you burn his

3934
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:11,160
Mana before The Shard so I I really like

3935
02:40:11,160 --> 02:40:12,960
the lgd draft I think it's uh much

3936
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:14,279
better than what they had last game they

3937
02:40:14,279 --> 02:40:15,880
also kind of don't have the ability to

3938
02:40:15,880 --> 02:40:19,000
get countered as hard so I feel very

3939
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,439
good for for them and I'm curious as

3940
02:40:21,439 --> 02:40:23,920
what Quinn will play this is you know he

3941
02:40:23,920 --> 02:40:26,479
knows pangier yeah is it another hoscar

3942
02:40:26,479 --> 02:40:29,359
game for him just purely of like how how

3943
02:40:29,359 --> 02:40:32,240
they can snow ball after this game I'm

3944
02:40:32,240 --> 02:40:33,359
I'm not too sure I think there's

3945
02:40:33,359 --> 02:40:34,600
probably a queen of pain angle I think

3946
02:40:34,600 --> 02:40:36,040
queen of pain is scales really nicely

3947
02:40:36,040 --> 02:40:38,359
verus Naga siren also there's not really

3948
02:40:38,359 --> 02:40:39,800
stuns that he has to worry about it's

3949
02:40:39,800 --> 02:40:42,160
only the route from Naga siren and so I

3950
02:40:42,160 --> 02:40:43,279
think queen of pain kind of has the

3951
02:40:43,279 --> 02:40:44,720
mobility also it ganks really well with

3952
02:40:44,720 --> 02:40:46,080
the fan that can set up everywhere

3953
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:47,880
across the map he just needs to now deal

3954
02:40:47,880 --> 02:40:49,800
with the Naga and have a stable ver Pang

3955
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:51,439
there two big goals I just really

3956
02:40:51,439 --> 02:40:53,479
believe in a husar I think you can allow

3957
02:40:53,479 --> 02:40:55,840
to have two M Heroes against the queen

3958
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:58,279
and not B the husar in the last Pi I

3959
02:40:58,279 --> 02:41:00,359
think he's he's chosing about it right

3960
02:41:00,359 --> 02:41:02,600
now he's thinking about it he's worried

3961
02:41:02,600 --> 02:41:03,840
he's telling him like don't worry man he

3962
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:06,840
W hus guards it's all good trying to

3963
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:08,520
ease those nerves don't think about it

3964
02:41:08,520 --> 02:41:09,960
don't think about

3965
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:13,560
it oh you're right that's a good thing

3966
02:41:13,560 --> 02:41:16,560
nice suggestion uh I I think it does

3967
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:17,840
check all the boxes for gaming

3968
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:19,840
gladiators but it's kind of

3969
02:41:19,840 --> 02:41:21,240
I again I'm really scared of this Naga I

3970
02:41:21,240 --> 02:41:22,439
thought the second that they pick chaos

3971
02:41:22,439 --> 02:41:23,479
Knight Naga was going to come out at

3972
02:41:23,479 --> 02:41:25,240
some point in the draft and so if

3973
02:41:25,240 --> 02:41:26,760
anything I would give lgd an edge right

3974
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:28,520
now yeah all right and what about

3975
02:41:28,520 --> 02:41:31,279
yourself sheep uh I think Gunner's

3976
02:41:31,279 --> 02:41:33,399
popped off kind of that's true you kind

3977
02:41:33,399 --> 02:41:34,680
of predicted everything yeah he really

3978
02:41:34,680 --> 02:41:37,439
did sorry no it was great I apologize I

3979
02:41:37,439 --> 02:41:38,800
agree with that I think lgd have a

3980
02:41:38,800 --> 02:41:40,319
stronger draft I think this Pango

3981
02:41:40,319 --> 02:41:41,479
brought everything together that was a

3982
02:41:41,479 --> 02:41:43,279
hero I was thinking of for ging to help

3983
02:41:43,279 --> 02:41:44,520
deal with the Naga but them just

3984
02:41:44,520 --> 02:41:47,359
sweeping it I think it just solidifies

3985
02:41:47,359 --> 02:41:48,680
their draft I think their High Ground is

3986
02:41:48,680 --> 02:41:51,479
way too scary to go into as well so even

3987
02:41:51,479 --> 02:41:53,640
if uh we focus naga's Lane time and time

3988
02:41:53,640 --> 02:41:55,160
again Ghana you think that that shutting

3989
02:41:55,160 --> 02:41:57,399
down isn't enough to build into gaming

3990
02:41:57,399 --> 02:41:58,880
Gladiators that everyone else on the

3991
02:41:58,880 --> 02:42:00,960
side of lgd will be able to make space

3992
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:02,279
yeah I think she got picked into pretty

3993
02:42:02,279 --> 02:42:03,720
much R king and K KN which are the same

3994
02:42:03,720 --> 02:42:04,960
hero that she'll Exel in the lane they

3995
02:42:04,960 --> 02:42:05,840
don't really have a way to clear the

3996
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:07,840
illusions that easily so her Lane should

3997
02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:09,600
be fine she can honestly be left alone

3998
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:11,399
after four or five minutes and her game

3999
02:42:11,399 --> 02:42:12,520
will be good the biggest thing is

4000
02:42:12,520 --> 02:42:13,920
whether Quinn can get a lot of work done

4001
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:15,520
in this mid matchup is kind of the way

4002
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:17,120
that GG wants to play is bring up mid

4003
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:18,200
Quinn's going to outplay the enemy mid

4004
02:42:18,200 --> 02:42:20,000
laner and just go from the

4005
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:21,840
I'm just worried about supports on the

4006
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:23,720
lgd side like how they going to protect

4007
02:42:23,720 --> 02:42:26,240
the Fango from the you know from being a

4008
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:28,399
run over with a queen and supports all

4009
02:42:28,399 --> 02:42:29,720
right we'll keep our eyes on Mid we'll

4010
02:42:29,720 --> 02:42:31,880
see how impactful this nager is and

4011
02:42:31,880 --> 02:42:33,840
we'll see how confident lgd are feeling

4012
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:35,560
about their

4013
02:42:35,560 --> 02:42:40,520
draft I am joined by sh of lgd and Helen

4014
02:42:40,520 --> 02:42:44,439
will be helping me translate Shia you

4015
02:42:44,439 --> 02:42:46,600
have played at countless TI you've

4016
02:42:46,600 --> 02:42:49,760
coached countless TI You've Won TI when

4017
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:51,680
you are looking at this tournament is

4018
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:53,439
there any one thing that's unique about

4019
02:42:53,439 --> 02:42:55,359
this International compared to others in

4020
02:42:55,359 --> 02:42:57,560
the

4021
02:43:09,630 --> 02:43:11,600
[Music]

4022
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:14,080
past it's been a while since I've been

4023
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:16,520
in Seattle so that familiar feeling is

4024
02:43:16,520 --> 02:43:19,680
coming back I'm happy to hear it but how

4025
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:21,399
about all the fans who are watching

4026
02:43:21,399 --> 02:43:23,479
across the world this may be your last

4027
02:43:23,479 --> 02:43:24,760
game is there anything you'd like to say

4028
02:43:24,760 --> 02:43:27,080
to them to get them excited that lgd is

4029
02:43:27,080 --> 02:43:29,720
going to continue

4030
02:43:38,870 --> 02:43:42,089
[Applause]

4031
02:43:42,120 --> 02:43:44,720
fighting we're going to get them they're

4032
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:46,840
going to get them let's get ready for

4033
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:49,240
game two

4034
02:43:49,240 --> 02:43:50,600
there we have it some good words of

4035
02:43:50,600 --> 02:43:52,240
confidence coming into this game two

4036
02:43:52,240 --> 02:43:54,120
here for lgd up against gaming

4037
02:43:54,120 --> 02:43:56,319
Gladiators a hard fought game one from

4038
02:43:56,319 --> 02:43:58,200
them for but they weren't able to do it

4039
02:43:58,200 --> 02:43:59,640
Gladiator pulling through in that first

4040
02:43:59,640 --> 02:44:01,160
game here in this game too what do you

4041
02:44:01,160 --> 02:44:02,479
think about the change UPS I'm seeing

4042
02:44:02,479 --> 02:44:04,279
already the fact that lgd they've got

4043
02:44:04,279 --> 02:44:06,840
Shir on this Naga siren if his Manta

4044
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:08,359
play was anything to go by in the last

4045
02:44:08,359 --> 02:44:09,840
game with the Luna you've only got to

4046
02:44:09,840 --> 02:44:10,840
imagine what he's going to be able to do

4047
02:44:10,840 --> 02:44:12,520
on a Naga siren yeah it feels like two

4048
02:44:12,520 --> 02:44:14,080
very different style drafts versus each

4049
02:44:14,080 --> 02:44:15,640
other a very fast-paced draft gaming

4050
02:44:15,640 --> 02:44:17,560
trying to just take advantage to slam

4051
02:44:17,560 --> 02:44:19,439
these Lanes in particular mid Quinn

4052
02:44:19,439 --> 02:44:21,200
going for his Quin of pain of course

4053
02:44:21,200 --> 02:44:22,240
they're trying to just Snowball the game

4054
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:24,000
out of control lgd trying to slow things

4055
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:25,760
down and if they can the draft looks

4056
02:44:25,760 --> 02:44:27,080
amazing right if they can get these

4057
02:44:27,080 --> 02:44:29,160
later stages this draft from lgd does

4058
02:44:29,160 --> 02:44:30,880
look like it will reign supreme but can

4059
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:32,399
they withstand the pressure gaming has

4060
02:44:32,399 --> 02:44:34,640
been the team to dictate the pace to

4061
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:36,560
dictate these quick games this could be

4062
02:44:36,560 --> 02:44:37,880
another one they're able to set up if

4063
02:44:37,880 --> 02:44:39,120
they set up this queen of pain in

4064
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:40,720
particular for that success sure and you

4065
02:44:40,720 --> 02:44:42,240
think sort of some rightful concerns

4066
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:43,960
from the panel as well with regards to

4067
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:45,399
what lgd supports are going to be able

4068
02:44:45,399 --> 02:44:47,000
to do early on to sort of enable the

4069
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:48,439
other lanes or or how do you think

4070
02:44:48,439 --> 02:44:49,920
that's going to play out I mean it's

4071
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:51,720
it's just difficult to be able to like

4072
02:44:51,720 --> 02:44:52,960
with the pro you know the Nature's

4073
02:44:52,960 --> 02:44:54,319
profit constantly making these rotations

4074
02:44:54,319 --> 02:44:55,520
with the teleport that's where something

4075
02:44:55,520 --> 02:44:56,399
they could struggle they're going to

4076
02:44:56,399 --> 02:44:57,840
have to like preemptively be ready for

4077
02:44:57,840 --> 02:44:59,960
the moves say already right the here

4078
02:44:59,960 --> 02:45:01,680
he's to get off the three Shield crash

4079
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:03,560
but still the the damage coming in he's

4080
02:45:03,560 --> 02:45:05,840
going to be first blood for cery the

4081
02:45:05,840 --> 02:45:07,279
power of the Nature's profit already

4082
02:45:07,279 --> 02:45:08,600
coming into fruition here with that

4083
02:45:08,600 --> 02:45:10,560
level one play whose blood grenade was

4084
02:45:10,560 --> 02:45:11,880
that was that celer I saw one being

4085
02:45:11,880 --> 02:45:14,200
thrown out uh yeah was okay so I mean

4086
02:45:14,200 --> 02:45:15,960
easy easy grab there for him getting set

4087
02:45:15,960 --> 02:45:17,240
up Quinn doesn't get the last hit but

4088
02:45:17,240 --> 02:45:19,000
either way does get an advantage inside

4089
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:19,920
that Middle Lane that's the way they're

4090
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:21,200
going to look to play I'm going to just

4091
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:23,800
watching accelery overall these TPS but

4092
02:45:23,800 --> 02:45:24,840
are they going to be able to slow down

4093
02:45:24,840 --> 02:45:26,479
Dao is the question cuz celer is going

4094
02:45:26,479 --> 02:45:28,080
to be constantly moving around perhaps

4095
02:45:28,080 --> 02:45:29,520
that's where new and planed are able to

4096
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:31,359
take some Advantage versus this chaos

4097
02:45:31,359 --> 02:45:33,120
Knight who usually just wins every

4098
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:34,600
single Lane yeah it talk to me more

4099
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:36,000
about this sort of queen of pain pick we

4100
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:37,560
just don't see it a lot but Quinn

4101
02:45:37,560 --> 02:45:38,840
realizing that this is the game to pull

4102
02:45:38,840 --> 02:45:40,399
it off what do you think it is directly

4103
02:45:40,399 --> 02:45:42,640
about this draft from lgd that's made

4104
02:45:42,640 --> 02:45:44,439
him want to get the queen of pain out

4105
02:45:44,439 --> 02:45:46,359
against it definitely limited stuns

4106
02:45:46,359 --> 02:45:47,560
right just looking overall what they

4107
02:45:47,560 --> 02:45:48,640
have they have to commit kind of like

4108
02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:50,439
ultim M there's a net and then there's a

4109
02:45:50,439 --> 02:45:52,760
Silence from the wera and a Deadshot

4110
02:45:52,760 --> 02:45:54,319
it's pretty limited these skill shots

4111
02:45:54,319 --> 02:45:55,640
are not the easiest things to land on

4112
02:45:55,640 --> 02:45:57,120
something like a queen of pain if he's

4113
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:59,080
able to get that big snowball Advantage

4114
02:45:59,080 --> 02:46:01,279
nothing to say getting seven of the last

4115
02:46:01,279 --> 02:46:02,800
hits on the first two waves though so

4116
02:46:02,800 --> 02:46:04,000
even though he does get killed right

4117
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,439
away very very good start for this Pango

4118
02:46:06,439 --> 02:46:07,960
but it gets it gets quite rough those

4119
02:46:07,960 --> 02:46:09,160
levels once they build up for the queen

4120
02:46:09,160 --> 02:46:11,920
of pain does get pretty difficult for

4121
02:46:11,920 --> 02:46:13,040
that Pango in the

4122
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:15,800
mid bottom Lane dra being kept very low

4123
02:46:15,800 --> 02:46:17,520
here by the harassment from new and

4124
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:19,319
Planet I mean how how strong of L is

4125
02:46:19,319 --> 02:46:21,279
this in your book in terms of the Magnus

4126
02:46:21,279 --> 02:46:24,040
and the Moa very strong yeah they I mean

4127
02:46:24,040 --> 02:46:25,439
it's Universal Magnus you always have

4128
02:46:25,439 --> 02:46:27,479
great right click this year I think cuz

4129
02:46:27,479 --> 02:46:28,600
he's been the one who actually was did

4130
02:46:28,600 --> 02:46:29,920
it first I think they were mentioned

4131
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:32,240
Chanel Theo has to turn turn with the

4132
02:46:32,240 --> 02:46:34,880
stun that a whole back new playing on

4133
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:37,000
the edge of his life here drao I'm glad

4134
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:38,279
to see more of the Magnus I feel this

4135
02:46:38,279 --> 02:46:40,359
Heroes always has potential in the off

4136
02:46:40,359 --> 02:46:41,920
Lane just to make so many out plays just

4137
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:43,680
to shock wave into to skewer plays

4138
02:46:43,680 --> 02:46:45,520
overall good base damage to get last HS

4139
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:47,560
I like this Lane a lot it's quite a bit

4140
02:46:47,560 --> 02:46:49,200
of attack speed slow too so even if they

4141
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:51,439
try to like turn and fight you you

4142
02:46:51,439 --> 02:46:53,439
skewer and you have this calling down

4143
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:54,960
both abilities of course slowing attack

4144
02:46:54,960 --> 02:46:56,560
speed it's really tough to fight versus

4145
02:46:56,560 --> 02:46:58,359
these

4146
02:46:58,359 --> 02:47:01,160
two looking at sort of the the top playe

4147
02:47:01,160 --> 02:47:03,560
W you smile on the Elder Titan a pretty

4148
02:47:03,560 --> 02:47:05,319
good game for et to combo up with some

4149
02:47:05,319 --> 02:47:07,040
of his teammates absolutely I mean he's

4150
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:08,479
playing it's all about the stalling

4151
02:47:08,479 --> 02:47:09,600
right stalling out the games they have

4152
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:11,040
the Magnus as well to two of the best

4153
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:13,560
womo comb and even with the N time they

4154
02:47:13,560 --> 02:47:16,359
get him still for from you Dao getting

4155
02:47:16,359 --> 02:47:18,200
punished the same time though Shir also

4156
02:47:18,200 --> 02:47:19,880
to fall both Carri is getting punished

4157
02:47:19,880 --> 02:47:22,240
in the safe flan oh wow the top one I

4158
02:47:22,240 --> 02:47:23,720
the top one I really wouldn't anticipate

4159
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:24,920
happening but the bottom one with the

4160
02:47:24,920 --> 02:47:26,279
way that they were bringing it to

4161
02:47:26,279 --> 02:47:28,160
Dao definitely more expected can't

4162
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:29,279
believe they killed this Naga with this

4163
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:31,000
Top Lane there a reason this wraith King

4164
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:32,920
has been constantly picked for this off

4165
02:47:32,920 --> 02:47:34,120
Lane how much he's able to do in the

4166
02:47:34,120 --> 02:47:35,840
early game and Ace he's been one of the

4167
02:47:35,840 --> 02:47:37,520
best with

4168
02:47:37,520 --> 02:47:39,920
it keeping eyes on this mid as well

4169
02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:42,240
definitely a match up where you could

4170
02:47:42,240 --> 02:47:44,479
you could see the solo kills occurring

4171
02:47:44,479 --> 02:47:45,920
both Heroes having to be cautious

4172
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:47,399
they've got good amounts of jump and

4173
02:47:47,399 --> 02:47:49,520
resets way to back up and and jump back

4174
02:47:49,520 --> 02:47:51,240
in if they catch one another low yeah

4175
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:52,319
nothing to say just has to be very

4176
02:47:52,319 --> 02:47:53,600
careful with how he uses those swash

4177
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:55,160
buckles a TP comes in from the Nature's

4178
02:47:55,160 --> 02:47:56,560
prop and it could just net a kill almost

4179
02:47:56,560 --> 02:47:59,399
immediately up top The Stomp gets the

4180
02:47:59,399 --> 02:48:01,120
Lotus two of them Shir trying to close

4181
02:48:01,120 --> 02:48:02,680
in onto tofu but tofu does have to

4182
02:48:02,680 --> 02:48:04,359
Shadow around with the and they've got

4183
02:48:04,359 --> 02:48:05,920
back up terer is in they turn the red

4184
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:07,479
five blast over toward Shir Shir getting

4185
02:48:07,479 --> 02:48:09,200
surrounded caught in the Sprout he Tak

4186
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:11,080
it out again could be have a good chance

4187
02:48:11,080 --> 02:48:12,840
of chasing why smile out as well as why

4188
02:48:12,840 --> 02:48:14,680
is SM trying to back off for the right

4189
02:48:14,680 --> 02:48:17,080
clicks on tofu are enough double kill

4190
02:48:17,080 --> 02:48:19,520
for tofu this Top Lane getting Messi

4191
02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:21,600
Messi already as soon as the Naga comes

4192
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:22,680
back and this is going to be the Long

4193
02:48:22,680 --> 02:48:25,240
Walk of Shame 30 seconds no TP so much

4194
02:48:25,240 --> 02:48:26,800
physical damage the blight Stone coming

4195
02:48:26,800 --> 02:48:28,240
in The Wraith king skeleton just hitting

4196
02:48:28,240 --> 02:48:30,040
on him there nothing the Naga can do

4197
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:31,720
these early deaths they absolutely hurt

4198
02:48:31,720 --> 02:48:34,920
Piro yep and Dao even though he did die

4199
02:48:34,920 --> 02:48:37,359
this hero overall it sustains on its own

4200
02:48:37,359 --> 02:48:39,040
really nicely two points up on the chaos

4201
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:41,000
strike for Dao so should be able to at

4202
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:42,680
least get this Farm under under the

4203
02:48:42,680 --> 02:48:45,200
tower here and Shir TP still on cool

4204
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:46,359
down he's having to take the smoke to

4205
02:48:46,359 --> 02:48:48,000
try and get back to Lane as quickly as

4206
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:49,240
he can

4207
02:48:49,240 --> 02:48:51,279
a big hit against the nagar in this

4208
02:48:51,279 --> 02:48:53,120
laning stage a massive one is also fnn

4209
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:54,359
can now go for the bottom room while

4210
02:48:54,359 --> 02:48:55,880
tofu checks the top one will nothing to

4211
02:48:55,880 --> 02:48:58,319
say be able to get it nope Quinn gets it

4212
02:48:58,319 --> 02:49:00,000
and now tofu's here to back up nothing

4213
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:01,520
to say as a squash he's going to get

4214
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:03,279
caught by the Bramble though still able

4215
02:49:03,279 --> 02:49:05,960
to jump away and will have to

4216
02:49:05,960 --> 02:49:08,399
potentially back off as this dagger kcks

4217
02:49:08,399 --> 02:49:11,359
him him for the kill another dagger

4218
02:49:11,359 --> 02:49:13,880
Quinn he's going to get it the kills

4219
02:49:13,880 --> 02:49:15,600
there Gladiator is finding a lot of

4220
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:17,239
early action done botom planet and knew

4221
02:49:17,239 --> 02:49:18,920
they tried for Cel but Cel is a but he

4222
02:49:18,920 --> 02:49:20,880
just walk away from them the stomp does

4223
02:49:20,880 --> 02:49:23,080
clip him can they finish shock wave will

4224
02:49:23,080 --> 02:49:24,720
drag him back new really wants the kill

4225
02:49:24,720 --> 02:49:26,880
he'll get him but now under Tower the

4226
02:49:26,880 --> 02:49:28,640
stuns there director trying to step up

4227
02:49:28,640 --> 02:49:30,800
see if he can finish on new in return

4228
02:49:30,800 --> 02:49:31,920
doesn't look like he have any further

4229
02:49:31,920 --> 02:49:33,920
grab 6 seconds to do the stuns back up

4230
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:35,479
in fact he might be in trouble himself

4231
02:49:35,479 --> 02:49:36,920
another dead shot connection from pet

4232
02:49:36,920 --> 02:49:39,640
into the shock wave got a Lotus may be

4233
02:49:39,640 --> 02:49:41,560
able to turno pet cu the stun it's back

4234
02:49:41,560 --> 02:49:43,640
up the crits are coming in the stop is

4235
02:49:43,640 --> 02:49:45,479
there just in time before Dr is able to

4236
02:49:45,479 --> 02:49:47,200
pull in planet with a reality Rift

4237
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:49,120
doesn't matter though celer s his grabs

4238
02:49:49,120 --> 02:49:51,200
him the vision to grab him back I mean

4239
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:52,800
now whyu smile's got to be cautious

4240
02:49:52,800 --> 02:49:54,239
direct has been handed over to tango he

4241
02:49:54,239 --> 02:49:56,319
can start healing up I look at new even

4242
02:49:56,319 --> 02:49:58,120
has to be careful with his positioning

4243
02:49:58,120 --> 02:50:00,080
Doro just standing Toe to Toe versus

4244
02:50:00,080 --> 02:50:01,800
three Heroes I mean again in the mid

4245
02:50:01,800 --> 02:50:03,560
lane nothing to say getting bullied by

4246
02:50:03,560 --> 02:50:06,000
Quinn and tofu as soon as he's back to

4247
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,840
the mid lane he's back out again then

4248
02:50:08,840 --> 02:50:11,279
without TP available and Ace is now in a

4249
02:50:11,279 --> 02:50:13,359
1 V one versus the nagas and he's more

4250
02:50:13,359 --> 02:50:14,840
than happy with that with this type of

4251
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:16,040
setup they have to just keep trying to

4252
02:50:16,040 --> 02:50:17,800
move these Lanes around on side of LTD

4253
02:50:17,800 --> 02:50:19,439
they need to do something and they will

4254
02:50:19,439 --> 02:50:21,359
Planet turns up make sure that this time

4255
02:50:21,359 --> 02:50:23,200
round shirou is able to get the kill

4256
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:24,800
against Ace I look at the aggression

4257
02:50:24,800 --> 02:50:26,800
it's 10 kills 5

4258
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:28,960
minutes gaming Gladiators their draft

4259
02:50:28,960 --> 02:50:30,359
definitely thrives off of this they want

4260
02:50:30,359 --> 02:50:31,800
to be the ones just dictating Pace

4261
02:50:31,800 --> 02:50:33,279
getting these early kills getting that

4262
02:50:33,279 --> 02:50:35,080
lane advantage and so far looking pretty

4263
02:50:35,080 --> 02:50:35,880
damn

4264
02:50:35,880 --> 02:50:38,200
good long walk back to the mid lane is

4265
02:50:38,200 --> 02:50:39,479
going to mean that there's going to be

4266
02:50:39,479 --> 02:50:41,200
quite the XP difference here between the

4267
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:44,279
mids qu already halfway through the six

4268
02:50:44,279 --> 02:50:45,840
and of course nothing to say yet to hit

4269
02:50:45,840 --> 02:50:47,239
his and it's right around the power run

4270
02:50:47,239 --> 02:50:48,840
two Quinn very likely to be a to set

4271
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:50,359
this one up planet has to play around

4272
02:50:50,359 --> 02:50:52,000
mid to try to stop this queen of pain

4273
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:53,560
from snowballing so

4274
02:50:53,560 --> 02:50:56,319
hard will he get

4275
02:50:56,319 --> 02:50:59,520
lucky planer will get it quick pause

4276
02:50:59,520 --> 02:51:02,399
okay get a crash okie dokie see a quick

4277
02:51:02,399 --> 02:51:04,359
reset here from Dao but as things have

4278
02:51:04,359 --> 02:51:05,720
gone in this first six minutes

4279
02:51:05,720 --> 02:51:07,680
Gladiators exactly the way they want an

4280
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:09,319
explosive opening really with these

4281
02:51:09,319 --> 02:51:11,080
moves that they've made and as was

4282
02:51:11,080 --> 02:51:12,760
expected with the power of C's Nature's

4283
02:51:12,760 --> 02:51:14,359
profit he's always been there as a plus

4284
02:51:14,359 --> 02:51:17,080
one I mean even tofu too 40 and two so

4285
02:51:17,080 --> 02:51:19,239
far right he is actually ahead of Daio

4286
02:51:19,239 --> 02:51:21,319
on Networth he's tied with almost all

4287
02:51:21,319 --> 02:51:23,760
the cores at this point as Willow

4288
02:51:23,760 --> 02:51:24,880
beautiful stuff I mean getting those

4289
02:51:24,880 --> 02:51:26,560
early kills up top making the rotations

4290
02:51:26,560 --> 02:51:28,439
onto mid so far means exactly what

4291
02:51:28,439 --> 02:51:29,640
gaming wants to do with their draft get

4292
02:51:29,640 --> 02:51:31,640
early kills snowball keep putting that

4293
02:51:31,640 --> 02:51:33,239
aggressive posture on the map theyve

4294
02:51:33,239 --> 02:51:34,359
they've kind of pushed Shir a little bit

4295
02:51:34,359 --> 02:51:35,840
to the Jungle already he has to move

4296
02:51:35,840 --> 02:51:37,960
away as this nagar so early in the game

4297
02:51:37,960 --> 02:51:40,640
he's got might is queued up it's going

4298
02:51:40,640 --> 02:51:41,960
to be one of those recovery games for

4299
02:51:41,960 --> 02:51:44,520
him after Lane like this those early

4300
02:51:44,520 --> 02:51:46,359
deaths slowing down sort of the

4301
02:51:46,359 --> 02:51:49,160
potential but as we saw last game l

4302
02:51:49,160 --> 02:51:51,279
they are very good at stalling the games

4303
02:51:51,279 --> 02:51:53,160
out even if the beginning goes rough

4304
02:51:53,160 --> 02:51:54,399
yeah they don't have a Shadow Demon

4305
02:51:54,399 --> 02:51:55,720
though to create those Illusions yes

4306
02:51:55,720 --> 02:51:57,200
they have the natural nasan but they

4307
02:51:57,200 --> 02:51:58,840
don't have a spirit breaker who just

4308
02:51:58,840 --> 02:52:00,279
literally clears every single wave a lot

4309
02:52:00,279 --> 02:52:01,600
more difficult for nothing to say would

4310
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:04,200
seem this game being slowed down this

4311
02:52:04,200 --> 02:52:06,439
much and losing I mean losing Lanes like

4312
02:52:06,439 --> 02:52:07,720
this also when you're playing versus

4313
02:52:07,720 --> 02:52:09,520
something like this this wraith King and

4314
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:10,640
this Nature's profit there's a reason

4315
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:12,040
that Gan likes to play this so much

4316
02:52:12,040 --> 02:52:14,359
right you pick up the tempo so fast so

4317
02:52:14,359 --> 02:52:15,840
if you start having to get pushed to

4318
02:52:15,840 --> 02:52:17,680
Jungle this early on the side of lgd

4319
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:19,160
these towers are going to start dropping

4320
02:52:19,160 --> 02:52:20,319
very very early on with the way that

4321
02:52:20,319 --> 02:52:22,160
they want to make moves with the the

4322
02:52:22,160 --> 02:52:24,000
sort of the start the supports of gaming

4323
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:25,560
Gladiators got and the fact that Quinn

4324
02:52:25,560 --> 02:52:27,680
is is in the lead right now it's it's

4325
02:52:27,680 --> 02:52:29,000
not going to be too difficult for

4326
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:30,680
gladiators to go for these deep

4327
02:52:30,680 --> 02:52:32,640
movements and try and catch shirro in

4328
02:52:32,640 --> 02:52:34,880
his jungle absolutely they just have to

4329
02:52:34,880 --> 02:52:36,359
watch out how far they overextend cuz

4330
02:52:36,359 --> 02:52:37,880
the way the counter initiation every

4331
02:52:37,880 --> 02:52:39,840
from lgd that's kind of their biggest

4332
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:41,880
Thrive is is if gaming pushes the limit

4333
02:52:41,880 --> 02:52:44,439
too far they have Wombo Combo team fight

4334
02:52:44,439 --> 02:52:46,200
they have massive ways of repositioning

4335
02:52:46,200 --> 02:52:47,680
and taking them under these tier tws

4336
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:50,439
potentially

4337
02:52:50,439 --> 02:52:52,399
so far early game exactly what gaming

4338
02:52:52,399 --> 02:52:53,840
Gladiators wants maybe even more than

4339
02:52:53,840 --> 02:52:55,000
they could have hoped for with Ace

4340
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:58,279
having such a damn good start in

4341
02:52:59,560 --> 02:53:01,920
top just not easy for nothing to say to

4342
02:53:01,920 --> 02:53:03,600
off around this med he's just trying to

4343
02:53:03,600 --> 02:53:05,720
at least find the XP for his level six

4344
02:53:05,720 --> 02:53:07,720
and a definitely having a very nice

4345
02:53:07,720 --> 02:53:08,560
understanding with this wraith King

4346
02:53:08,560 --> 02:53:10,200
playing versus the nagas versus the ET

4347
02:53:10,200 --> 02:53:11,680
he's all about that plus armor he's got

4348
02:53:11,680 --> 02:53:12,840
the Ring of protection I believe he

4349
02:53:12,840 --> 02:53:14,120
started with wraith band right

4350
02:53:14,120 --> 02:53:15,800
afterwards and phas boot so hard for

4351
02:53:15,800 --> 02:53:17,000
them to really bring him out of this

4352
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:20,760
Lane with this with this Naga or the

4353
02:53:23,279 --> 02:53:26,880
CT L to restabilize Dao now able to get

4354
02:53:26,880 --> 02:53:29,239
this free

4355
02:53:29,239 --> 02:53:31,239
Farm why you smart maybe see if we can

4356
02:53:31,239 --> 02:53:33,800
go for some sort of Stomp play to grab

4357
02:53:33,800 --> 02:53:36,760
the wisdom but it's a risky play for

4358
02:53:36,760 --> 02:53:38,720
profit he's not going to be able to stop

4359
02:53:38,720 --> 02:53:40,319
them from securing it themselves the

4360
02:53:40,319 --> 02:53:41,680
Gladiators in fact he actually gets

4361
02:53:41,680 --> 02:53:44,760
caught a indeed is ready with the stun

4362
02:53:44,760 --> 02:53:47,720
puts a stop to the TP so not only not

4363
02:53:47,720 --> 02:53:49,200
getting the chance to to grab the wisdom

4364
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:51,880
room he ends up losing his life to Ace

4365
02:53:51,880 --> 02:53:53,120
such a quick movement there from Ace

4366
02:53:53,120 --> 02:53:54,680
don't think that the ET expected him to

4367
02:53:54,680 --> 02:53:56,080
move that quick and he's queued up the

4368
02:53:56,080 --> 02:53:57,800
radiance now already so going to have

4369
02:53:57,800 --> 02:53:59,800
that itemization even versus the nagar

4370
02:53:59,800 --> 02:54:02,200
As game does potentially progress he is

4371
02:54:02,200 --> 02:54:05,960
incredibly farmed so far on this wraith

4372
02:54:06,720 --> 02:54:09,359
King I mean for lgd can they look for

4373
02:54:09,359 --> 02:54:11,120
aggressive moves themselves or is it

4374
02:54:11,120 --> 02:54:13,319
just a case of them preparing to turn

4375
02:54:13,319 --> 02:54:15,200
things around if gaming Gladiators start

4376
02:54:15,200 --> 02:54:16,520
heading onto their half of the map they

4377
02:54:16,520 --> 02:54:18,000
need more levels for sure I mean the big

4378
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:19,359
one that usually wants to make the moves

4379
02:54:19,359 --> 02:54:20,880
is going to be that mid laner but when

4380
02:54:20,880 --> 02:54:22,200
he's playing versus queen of and he's

4381
02:54:22,200 --> 02:54:24,200
super shut down and new also it's level

4382
02:54:24,200 --> 02:54:26,359
four Magnus Now versus the level six CK

4383
02:54:26,359 --> 02:54:28,120
Dao is perfectly fine to be left alone

4384
02:54:28,120 --> 02:54:29,680
down here so difficult for them to

4385
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:31,319
really make moves in this early game now

4386
02:54:31,319 --> 02:54:33,040
as they set on panel these supports

4387
02:54:33,040 --> 02:54:35,040
they're kind of needed with with the

4388
02:54:35,040 --> 02:54:36,160
cores they have to make the moves with

4389
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:37,479
the cores in

4390
02:54:37,479 --> 02:54:39,200
particular this say will get another

4391
02:54:39,200 --> 02:54:41,239
Power Rune Quinn they're trying to set

4392
02:54:41,239 --> 02:54:43,439
up but it's so hard they need kind of

4393
02:54:43,439 --> 02:54:45,200
the silent from the the calling to to

4394
02:54:45,200 --> 02:54:46,840
Really clip him outside of that Quinn

4395
02:54:46,840 --> 02:54:48,520
he's jumping away every time yeah they

4396
02:54:48,520 --> 02:54:49,800
need like the perfect kind of chain St

4397
02:54:49,800 --> 02:54:50,880
with the Rolling Thunder and everything

4398
02:54:50,880 --> 02:54:53,840
that's why they wanted this poop very

4399
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:56,000
elusive still looking to play around mid

4400
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:57,720
too they got three Heroes poised on the

4401
02:54:57,720 --> 02:54:59,120
side of gaming gladers looking to still

4402
02:54:59,120 --> 02:55:00,920
go for nothing to

4403
02:55:00,920 --> 02:55:04,520
say almost eight on

4404
02:55:06,840 --> 02:55:08,600
Quinn actually is going to instantly

4405
02:55:08,600 --> 02:55:09,920
smoke him takes the point in the sonic

4406
02:55:09,920 --> 02:55:11,560
wave he wants to look keeping the pre

4407
02:55:11,560 --> 02:55:13,520
look to keep the pressure going here I

4408
02:55:13,520 --> 02:55:15,239
mean wouldn't be a bad catch finding you

4409
02:55:15,239 --> 02:55:16,200
he's already had a bit of a tough time

4410
02:55:16,200 --> 02:55:18,680
in the lane if they could him down will

4411
02:55:18,680 --> 02:55:20,279
be able to break that smoke at they'll

4412
02:55:20,279 --> 02:55:22,479
see what's coming but look at Dao's

4413
02:55:22,479 --> 02:55:24,200
positioning he still wants to dive new I

4414
02:55:24,200 --> 02:55:25,479
mean who wants to come down here to help

4415
02:55:25,479 --> 02:55:27,399
him TPS are going to be coming over got

4416
02:55:27,399 --> 02:55:29,319
the caught by the BR though nothing to

4417
02:55:29,319 --> 02:55:30,800
say the stuns out for Dra nothing to say

4418
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:32,000
he's got the Rolling Thunder the ready

4419
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:33,479
but the Sol way point to the two of them

4420
02:55:33,479 --> 02:55:36,640
back new has now nothing to say he's got

4421
02:55:36,640 --> 02:55:38,880
to run perfect angle from Quinn to get

4422
02:55:38,880 --> 02:55:41,880
that push back stops him in his

4423
02:55:41,880 --> 02:55:44,680
tracks gaming just continue to keep

4424
02:55:44,680 --> 02:55:47,080
Advantage going and Planet be careful

4425
02:55:47,080 --> 02:55:48,840
he's going to miss the dead shot the

4426
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:50,880
stuns there I mean planet he's gone as

4427
02:55:50,880 --> 02:55:52,720
well that in an instant they just can't

4428
02:55:52,720 --> 02:55:54,319
fight them at this point despite how

4429
02:55:54,319 --> 02:55:56,399
hard they try LG and I mean without

4430
02:55:56,399 --> 02:55:58,000
rolling thunder now they cannot protect

4431
02:55:58,000 --> 02:55:59,760
this Tower top also looks get starting

4432
02:55:59,760 --> 02:56:01,359
to get pressure rotation from tofu

4433
02:56:01,359 --> 02:56:02,960
coming in with

4434
02:56:02,960 --> 02:56:05,560
Ace pressure on all fronts 10 to three a

4435
02:56:05,560 --> 02:56:08,200
4K lead already pre 10 minutes gaming

4436
02:56:08,200 --> 02:56:11,080
doing what they do

4437
02:56:12,479 --> 02:56:14,720
best daa almost having he's going to

4438
02:56:14,720 --> 02:56:16,080
have his armlet pretty much done already

4439
02:56:16,080 --> 02:56:17,760
Shiro is starting to get some recovery

4440
02:56:17,760 --> 02:56:19,600
Farm but he's not really the one who

4441
02:56:19,600 --> 02:56:21,359
makes plays to recover things he's the

4442
02:56:21,359 --> 02:56:22,680
one who has to just kind of sit back and

4443
02:56:22,680 --> 02:56:24,760
farm for a very very long time the fact

4444
02:56:24,760 --> 02:56:25,920
that this off lane and mid lane are

4445
02:56:25,920 --> 02:56:28,000
struggling so much it's going to be very

4446
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:29,200
difficult for lgd to mount these

4447
02:56:29,200 --> 02:56:31,040
defenses on these early

4448
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:33,439
Towers it's going to take time for for

4449
02:56:33,439 --> 02:56:35,520
sort of 300 gold in towards the blink

4450
02:56:35,520 --> 02:56:38,160
dagger yeah he's very

4451
02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:40,479
poor it's tier one in the mid lane

4452
02:56:40,479 --> 02:56:42,520
starting to take get a bit of a beat

4453
02:56:42,520 --> 02:56:43,800
down here by

4454
02:56:43,800 --> 02:56:46,160
Dao he's actually ready to start

4455
02:56:46,160 --> 02:56:47,960
jungling over on lgd side of the map he

4456
02:56:47,960 --> 02:56:50,120
knows that there's very little that lgd

4457
02:56:50,120 --> 02:56:52,040
can do to push back the CK I mean he

4458
02:56:52,040 --> 02:56:53,279
knows they're just very underleveled

4459
02:56:53,279 --> 02:56:55,000
Magnus still not quite level six the two

4460
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:56,640
supports as well too their damages just

4461
02:56:56,640 --> 02:56:58,600
extremely lackluster on the side of lgd

4462
02:56:58,600 --> 02:57:00,239
the only damage they really have is

4463
02:57:00,239 --> 02:57:01,520
going to be coming out from the Pango

4464
02:57:01,520 --> 02:57:03,120
right now and this Pango is very shut

4465
02:57:03,120 --> 02:57:06,439
down in this game top Tower to fall

4466
02:57:06,439 --> 02:57:09,120
a he's getting the chance to step up and

4467
02:57:09,120 --> 02:57:10,720
trade hits here with Shir right up

4468
02:57:10,720 --> 02:57:12,439
towards close to the tier two look how

4469
02:57:12,439 --> 02:57:13,880
confident he is they can't him they

4470
02:57:13,880 --> 02:57:15,239
don't have damage for him by this point

4471
02:57:15,239 --> 02:57:16,720
they does even have the armlet just yet

4472
02:57:16,720 --> 02:57:18,359
I mean isir is just getting chased out

4473
02:57:18,359 --> 02:57:19,880
completely from his

4474
02:57:19,880 --> 02:57:21,960
jungle and immediately he has a wave

4475
02:57:21,960 --> 02:57:23,760
bottom meets his Tower Dao just heads

4476
02:57:23,760 --> 02:57:25,600
back over as they take out top Tower Ace

4477
02:57:25,600 --> 02:57:26,600
is going to have this I mean this is

4478
02:57:26,600 --> 02:57:27,720
going to be one of the faster off Lane

4479
02:57:27,720 --> 02:57:29,560
radiances that comes out and it's a

4480
02:57:29,560 --> 02:57:31,080
great Radiance game playing versus this

4481
02:57:31,080 --> 02:57:35,040
KN turn qu continue to play incredibly

4482
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:36,680
aggressive here push the limits I me you

4483
02:57:36,680 --> 02:57:39,319
got tofu coming in from the side as well

4484
02:57:39,319 --> 02:57:40,800
and look at Dau I me he just pops a

4485
02:57:40,800 --> 02:57:42,479
fantasm and sends the illusion on new

4486
02:57:42,479 --> 02:57:44,120
and just zones him out of the lane new

4487
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:45,960
actually can't walk up and contest an

4488
02:57:45,960 --> 02:57:48,960
illusion

4489
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:50,239
and could just die if he steps up a

4490
02:57:50,239 --> 02:57:51,760
little bit too far that's to be pretty

4491
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:53,359
careful same to be said for nothing to

4492
02:57:53,359 --> 02:57:55,000
say he's having to go right back under

4493
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:56,399
the tier two cannot show his face

4494
02:57:56,399 --> 02:57:58,760
anywhere close to one going to try T it

4495
02:57:58,760 --> 02:57:59,880
down bottom SK is only going to be on

4496
02:57:59,880 --> 02:58:02,560
towards the fantasm maybe they can find

4497
02:58:02,560 --> 02:58:05,160
CER they get the stomp set up D's

4498
02:58:05,160 --> 02:58:06,560
considering maybe helping out on this

4499
02:58:06,560 --> 02:58:08,720
fight but the they're in with the stun

4500
02:58:08,720 --> 02:58:10,279
sonic wave pushing back the three of

4501
02:58:10,279 --> 02:58:11,760
them it's actually given the space for

4502
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:16,359
celer to walk away he's perfectly fine D

4503
02:58:16,359 --> 02:58:18,760
considering nothing say tripped up by

4504
02:58:18,760 --> 02:58:21,080
the Spells of tofu is the dump Forge

4505
02:58:21,080 --> 02:58:23,120
there from Quinn nothing is day taken

4506
02:58:23,120 --> 02:58:25,840
down they just can't kill any of them

4507
02:58:25,840 --> 02:58:28,760
not evener again and a Quinn this time a

4508
02:58:28,760 --> 02:58:30,600
sonic wave just to knock back the Pango

4509
02:58:30,600 --> 02:58:32,359
works out perfectly completely messing

4510
02:58:32,359 --> 02:58:34,239
with nothing to say this Pango is having

4511
02:58:34,239 --> 02:58:35,560
no effective this night right now can't

4512
02:58:35,560 --> 02:58:37,840
even touch accelery a 6K lead already

4513
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:40,000
for gaming Gladiators this is as hot as

4514
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:41,920
a start as you can get

4515
02:58:41,920 --> 02:58:44,120
really The Relic is done the radiance is

4516
02:58:44,120 --> 02:58:46,359
going to be coming up with 13 14 minutes

4517
02:58:46,359 --> 02:58:48,239
for Ace

4518
02:58:48,239 --> 02:58:51,680
oh oh oh it's a Dao I was say it's bound

4519
02:58:51,680 --> 02:58:53,439
to happen it hasn't happened much at I

4520
02:58:53,439 --> 02:58:55,560
feel when he dies like this the win is

4521
02:58:55,560 --> 02:58:58,520
pretty much guaranteed uh you know can't

4522
02:58:58,520 --> 02:59:00,439
believe it always happens we should have

4523
02:59:00,439 --> 02:59:02,160
had a camera on him that was unexpected

4524
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:05,080
we'll get a replay okay well as I say uh

4525
02:59:05,080 --> 02:59:06,439
when that's happened before he pretty

4526
02:59:06,439 --> 02:59:08,359
much always wins the game so um you know

4527
02:59:08,359 --> 02:59:10,920
all path the course hereo can't believe

4528
02:59:10,920 --> 02:59:15,120
it always happens oh my

4529
02:59:15,520 --> 02:59:17,640
goodness things calming down for a few

4530
02:59:17,640 --> 02:59:19,640
moments here but gaming have I mean

4531
02:59:19,640 --> 02:59:21,160
they've hit so hard in these first 12

4532
02:59:21,160 --> 02:59:22,520
minutes what more could you ask for all

4533
02:59:22,520 --> 02:59:24,160
three tier ones taken out you've

4534
02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:25,720
completely shut down the Pango the

4535
02:59:25,720 --> 02:59:27,680
Magnus his timings are all shot as well

4536
02:59:27,680 --> 02:59:29,319
too you're having three cores farming

4537
02:59:29,319 --> 02:59:31,200
perfectly and the two supports as well

4538
02:59:31,200 --> 02:59:32,880
too look at how Farm the two of them are

4539
02:59:32,880 --> 02:59:34,720
neck and neck 3600 gold on the two of

4540
02:59:34,720 --> 02:59:36,399
them and yeah Radiance it's it's going

4541
02:59:36,399 --> 02:59:38,720
to be done already so he's going to have

4542
02:59:38,720 --> 02:59:40,200
that way to just control the map even

4543
02:59:40,200 --> 02:59:41,439
more and have the counter versus the

4544
02:59:41,439 --> 02:59:44,760
nasar and even as game

4545
02:59:45,040 --> 02:59:47,040
progresses these passive moments just

4546
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:49,359
not favoring lgd at all see it again

4547
02:59:49,359 --> 02:59:51,200
here I mean at this point we all knew

4548
02:59:51,200 --> 02:59:52,520
there was a high likelihood something

4549
02:59:52,520 --> 02:59:55,760
was going to go wrong and it did oh my

4550
02:59:55,760 --> 03:00:00,080
God any there we go toea with a smile

4551
03:00:00,080 --> 03:00:02,720
for that one Quinn did not whole Serious

4552
03:00:02,720 --> 03:00:04,279
Business from Quinn he weren't happy how

4553
03:00:04,279 --> 03:00:06,160
dare you and my perfect queen of pain

4554
03:00:06,160 --> 03:00:07,520
game what are you

4555
03:00:07,520 --> 03:00:09,560
doing look how aggressive they're still

4556
03:00:09,560 --> 03:00:11,200
posturing though continuing just go for

4557
03:00:11,200 --> 03:00:13,720
nothing say no space for this

4558
03:00:13,720 --> 03:00:16,640
man uhoh man I mean jawe gave him some

4559
03:00:16,640 --> 03:00:18,479
rubs on the shoulders but so far it's

4560
03:00:18,479 --> 03:00:20,960
not helping

4561
03:00:21,319 --> 03:00:23,439
050 they're trying to find anything that

4562
03:00:23,439 --> 03:00:25,520
they can to get look at this W smile now

4563
03:00:25,520 --> 03:00:26,920
positioning for wisdom room potentially

4564
03:00:26,920 --> 03:00:28,239
trying to get the two of them stolen at

4565
03:00:28,239 --> 03:00:30,439
least but to already running

4566
03:00:30,439 --> 03:00:32,640
over and celer is even teing in

4567
03:00:32,640 --> 03:00:33,800
aggressively they're just going to take

4568
03:00:33,800 --> 03:00:35,680
both it seems on the side maybe with a

4569
03:00:35,680 --> 03:00:37,960
stomp why you SM can get this one no to

4570
03:00:37,960 --> 03:00:39,560
a to kite it out gets back in picks it

4571
03:00:39,560 --> 03:00:42,160
up will be able to grab their own okay D

4572
03:00:42,160 --> 03:00:43,840
actually isolated new is here as well

4573
03:00:43,840 --> 03:00:45,279
see if they can get it they got the skew

4574
03:00:45,279 --> 03:00:47,319
up they'll try and turn but this time

4575
03:00:47,319 --> 03:00:49,960
ooh nice on it might be allowing them to

4576
03:00:49,960 --> 03:00:50,960
get the two of them actually cuz now

4577
03:00:50,960 --> 03:00:52,239
they can set up over towards CER they

4578
03:00:52,239 --> 03:00:54,000
kill off Daio they close the gap in on

4579
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:55,960
toward C gets clipped by the Deadshot a

4580
03:00:55,960 --> 03:00:57,880
couple of kills here for LD nicely done

4581
03:00:57,880 --> 03:00:59,160
from shirro I mean he's the one with a

4582
03:00:59,160 --> 03:01:00,520
minus and he's the one actually making

4583
03:01:00,520 --> 03:01:01,920
the plays happen here to bring some

4584
03:01:01,920 --> 03:01:05,359
stuff back nicely done and they got the

4585
03:01:05,359 --> 03:01:07,520
wisdom something finally gone for the

4586
03:01:07,520 --> 03:01:09,760
side of

4587
03:01:09,760 --> 03:01:12,319
lgd that area of the map not not really

4588
03:01:12,319 --> 03:01:13,880
been a happy place for Duro in these

4589
03:01:13,880 --> 03:01:16,760
last few moments back ends up denying

4590
03:01:16,760 --> 03:01:17,920
himself and also ends up getting kill

4591
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:19,120
killed off probably not a place we'll

4592
03:01:19,120 --> 03:01:22,319
see him head back to anytime soon but as

4593
03:01:22,319 --> 03:01:23,640
probably says don't worry guys I'm the

4594
03:01:23,640 --> 03:01:26,080
real carry I mean it's all a distraction

4595
03:01:26,080 --> 03:01:27,560
it certainly seems that way cuz indeed

4596
03:01:27,560 --> 03:01:29,920
he continues to match the farm of shirro

4597
03:01:29,920 --> 03:01:31,200
and I just I mean I this is going to be

4598
03:01:31,200 --> 03:01:32,960
one of the slower timings I think we see

4599
03:01:32,960 --> 03:01:34,359
comes out for nothing to say this

4600
03:01:34,359 --> 03:01:36,120
diffusal blade it's been slowed down so

4601
03:01:36,120 --> 03:01:37,840
much he still doesn't have it he's still

4602
03:01:37,840 --> 03:01:40,000
about 800 gold

4603
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,160
away Midas they're just going to be

4604
03:01:42,160 --> 03:01:43,960
going for all the way to this late game

4605
03:01:43,960 --> 03:01:46,239
here double Midas is coming out for lgd

4606
03:01:46,239 --> 03:01:49,840
shirro he's caught

4607
03:01:49,840 --> 03:01:51,160
going to get clipp by the sonic wave

4608
03:01:51,160 --> 03:01:52,520
once more nothing to say getting pushed

4609
03:01:52,520 --> 03:01:54,279
back have to use the remainder of the

4610
03:01:54,279 --> 03:01:56,520
Rolling Thunder to just Retreat cannot

4611
03:01:56,520 --> 03:01:57,600
afford to go into The High Ground

4612
03:01:57,600 --> 03:01:58,720
against gaming Gladiator his bottom

4613
03:01:58,720 --> 03:02:01,960
length drao he's alone I mean he still

4614
03:02:01,960 --> 03:02:03,560
feels just sort of super confident to

4615
03:02:03,560 --> 03:02:05,080
play like this and just be this

4616
03:02:05,080 --> 03:02:06,720
distraction really just try and draw the

4617
03:02:06,720 --> 03:02:09,200
attention of lgd down here and away from

4618
03:02:09,200 --> 03:02:11,399
Ace it's very typical D all right just

4619
03:02:11,399 --> 03:02:13,160
just getting in their faces super

4620
03:02:13,160 --> 03:02:14,920
aggressive sometimes over aggressive but

4621
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:16,840
either way it's his place down it works

4622
03:02:16,840 --> 03:02:19,920
time and time again does it really

4623
03:02:19,920 --> 03:02:22,359
does look at these Illusions they die so

4624
03:02:22,359 --> 03:02:24,560
fast extra bit of gold going for celery

4625
03:02:24,560 --> 03:02:26,160
going straight down that pipe route

4626
03:02:26,160 --> 03:02:27,640
himself to after the solar Crest just

4627
03:02:27,640 --> 03:02:32,279
looking to ball up 7K lead Quinn oh does

4628
03:02:32,279 --> 03:02:33,720
get caught by the net got the opening

4629
03:02:33,720 --> 03:02:35,120
net do they have the follow up for the

4630
03:02:35,120 --> 03:02:36,720
silence the dead shot as well is

4631
03:02:36,720 --> 03:02:39,560
perfectly done but enough no way still

4632
03:02:39,560 --> 03:02:41,800
able to Blink away the wraparound coming

4633
03:02:41,800 --> 03:02:43,319
in from a with the red fire blast and

4634
03:02:43,319 --> 03:02:44,960
the skeletons over towards why you smile

4635
03:02:44,960 --> 03:02:47,200
why you smile he's able to move speed up

4636
03:02:47,200 --> 03:02:48,680
here H enough mov be to get away from

4637
03:02:48,680 --> 03:02:49,840
him a trying to turn his attention

4638
03:02:49,840 --> 03:02:52,200
towards more but lgd CED out this

4639
03:02:52,200 --> 03:02:54,520
counter play from face plan it back in

4640
03:02:54,520 --> 03:02:55,960
range of the The Wraith King though is

4641
03:02:55,960 --> 03:02:58,600
Ace with the back of accelery should be

4642
03:02:58,600 --> 03:03:00,279
able to block off his escape the stun

4643
03:03:00,279 --> 03:03:02,479
comes in the crits come out they take

4644
03:03:02,479 --> 03:03:04,200
Planet down I think you can imagine the

4645
03:03:04,200 --> 03:03:05,439
Gaming's going to look to really

4646
03:03:05,439 --> 03:03:06,680
accelerate things as soon as they see

4647
03:03:06,680 --> 03:03:08,439
new the Magnus having a Midas they're

4648
03:03:08,439 --> 03:03:10,080
probably like guys let's go go go they

4649
03:03:10,080 --> 03:03:12,080
have no blink dagger on mag every single

4650
03:03:12,080 --> 03:03:14,080
time Dr is just going straight for new

4651
03:03:14,080 --> 03:03:16,120
anytime you shows his face on the Lane

4652
03:03:16,120 --> 03:03:17,560
right lgd they're playing for the Super

4653
03:03:17,560 --> 03:03:19,239
Lane game right this might is queued up

4654
03:03:19,239 --> 03:03:21,000
top gaming probably wants to keep

4655
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,840
pushing down for this Tower glyph is

4656
03:03:23,840 --> 03:03:25,920
down can't believe Quinn gets away I

4657
03:03:25,920 --> 03:03:27,760
mean he is very tanky at this point I

4658
03:03:27,760 --> 03:03:28,960
mean and they really did everything they

4659
03:03:28,960 --> 03:03:30,680
could to lock him down it just wasn't

4660
03:03:30,680 --> 03:03:33,000
enough it was pretty much perfect but

4661
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,479
yeah the occult bracelet the magic

4662
03:03:35,479 --> 03:03:37,279
resistance just get 2,000 HP on this

4663
03:03:37,279 --> 03:03:38,479
queen of pain cuz that Advantage he's

4664
03:03:38,479 --> 03:03:39,640
gotten from the early game all right

4665
03:03:39,640 --> 03:03:41,359
blink done on you are you smoking up on

4666
03:03:41,359 --> 03:03:42,840
lgd to make a play around this or you's

4667
03:03:42,840 --> 03:03:43,920
still sitting back and looking for the

4668
03:03:43,920 --> 03:03:45,239
counter plays I think they can look to

4669
03:03:45,239 --> 03:03:46,720
make plays with the Pango and the Magnus

4670
03:03:46,720 --> 03:03:49,720
for sure

4671
03:03:51,319 --> 03:03:52,399
still I mean they're going to be playing

4672
03:03:52,399 --> 03:03:54,000
for later stages but if they can find

4673
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:55,560
Opportunities to catch Heroes that are

4674
03:03:55,560 --> 03:03:57,520
pushed up too far toward these tier tws

4675
03:03:57,520 --> 03:03:58,640
they can definitely get some kills maybe

4676
03:03:58,640 --> 03:04:00,359
even surprise ones on to something like

4677
03:04:00,359 --> 03:04:02,720
Ace penel was talking about the the mana

4678
03:04:02,720 --> 03:04:04,200
burn sometimes from the Pango can be a

4679
03:04:04,200 --> 03:04:05,800
little bit of an issue for these W kings

4680
03:04:05,800 --> 03:04:06,800
ace is just going to go straight for

4681
03:04:06,800 --> 03:04:08,800
that Shard next catch bottom go the

4682
03:04:08,800 --> 03:04:10,640
split up do they have enough it's a huge

4683
03:04:10,640 --> 03:04:13,479
amount of damage not quite enough

4684
03:04:13,479 --> 03:04:16,439
yet does get as well making sure that

4685
03:04:16,439 --> 03:04:19,359
these illusions able to finish Duro off

4686
03:04:19,359 --> 03:04:21,439
I Shiro is he is getting quite involved

4687
03:04:21,439 --> 03:04:22,760
with this nagas just trying to bring

4688
03:04:22,760 --> 03:04:24,160
things back together for his team I mean

4689
03:04:24,160 --> 03:04:25,960
he really did so much last game keeping

4690
03:04:25,960 --> 03:04:27,760
it going into Luna with the Illusions

4691
03:04:27,760 --> 03:04:31,239
this very much even more perfect hero

4692
03:04:31,239 --> 03:04:32,960
for him to play when it comes to just

4693
03:04:32,960 --> 03:04:35,439
keeping the game going buying time for

4694
03:04:35,439 --> 03:04:38,000
the entire team of lgd to

4695
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,600
scale there's that Shard for Ace doesn't

4696
03:04:40,600 --> 03:04:42,399
have to worry about that mana burn

4697
03:04:42,399 --> 03:04:45,239
coming into play here lgd still looking

4698
03:04:45,239 --> 03:04:48,120
for a player at DD now on nothing to say

4699
03:04:48,120 --> 03:04:49,040
they want to get something done with

4700
03:04:49,040 --> 03:04:50,760
this

4701
03:04:50,760 --> 03:04:54,200
blink a solo RP would absolutely cut it

4702
03:04:54,200 --> 03:04:55,520
they they'll go for Quinn if they want

4703
03:04:55,520 --> 03:04:57,920
to about it can they get the cat they

4704
03:04:57,920 --> 03:04:59,399
straight in they get the drag back this

4705
03:04:59,399 --> 03:05:00,920
time have they got enough lock down to

4706
03:05:00,920 --> 03:05:04,479
sleep the alive pushes back you and Quin

4707
03:05:04,479 --> 03:05:06,239
is's able to jump away turn with the

4708
03:05:06,239 --> 03:05:09,120
sonic wave and walk this one off as Ace

4709
03:05:09,120 --> 03:05:10,560
he's considering getting involved he he

4710
03:05:10,560 --> 03:05:12,000
starts to set straight towards them

4711
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:12,960
feeling strong with the fact that he's

4712
03:05:12,960 --> 03:05:15,040
got that shot hasy The Reincarnation

4713
03:05:15,040 --> 03:05:16,640
ready to use aggressively I they just

4714
03:05:16,640 --> 03:05:18,160
use so much

4715
03:05:18,160 --> 03:05:19,439
use their Pango roll they Ed their

4716
03:05:19,439 --> 03:05:21,200
Magnus too so gaming they're going to

4717
03:05:21,200 --> 03:05:23,080
run at them right here celer tping up

4718
03:05:23,080 --> 03:05:24,600
top already looking for nothing to say

4719
03:05:24,600 --> 03:05:26,680
he got backup coming in but they want

4720
03:05:26,680 --> 03:05:30,040
this Tower it's 300

4721
03:05:30,880 --> 03:05:33,800
HP Quinn just keeps getting away over

4722
03:05:33,800 --> 03:05:36,399
and over again

4723
03:05:36,520 --> 03:05:39,040
here a nice attempt there though from

4724
03:05:39,040 --> 03:05:42,080
lgd they had they had to go for

4725
03:05:42,080 --> 03:05:44,000
it I mean look how aggressive he's

4726
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,439
playing even near the tier two the

4727
03:05:46,439 --> 03:05:48,640
Magnus is this is this this is dangerous

4728
03:05:48,640 --> 03:05:50,040
positions here though those skewer plays

4729
03:05:50,040 --> 03:05:51,800
near tier 2 is is something they still

4730
03:05:51,800 --> 03:05:54,399
have to do respect on the side of gaming

4731
03:05:54,399 --> 03:05:56,760
Dao we're closing in on the the bkb

4732
03:05:56,760 --> 03:05:58,120
timeing he's got it pretty soon if he

4733
03:05:58,120 --> 03:05:59,880
wants to take about the

4734
03:05:59,880 --> 03:06:02,080
echo still looking to keep accelerating

4735
03:06:02,080 --> 03:06:03,600
things with these ult on cool down 550

4736
03:06:03,600 --> 03:06:05,760
seconds no RP 28 on the Rolling Thunder

4737
03:06:05,760 --> 03:06:09,359
top Tower will

4738
03:06:09,600 --> 03:06:13,200
fall Ace has skeletons pre at the ready

4739
03:06:13,200 --> 03:06:15,319
too they want to keep threatening it all

4740
03:06:15,319 --> 03:06:16,600
here maybe swing toward the mid lane

4741
03:06:16,600 --> 03:06:18,040
they've actually dragged the wave from

4742
03:06:18,040 --> 03:06:20,160
mid Daio to look to keep this pressure

4743
03:06:20,160 --> 03:06:23,239
going Quinn taking out Shiro bottom

4744
03:06:23,239 --> 03:06:24,800
smoke time from gaming glates at this

4745
03:06:24,800 --> 03:06:26,439
time

4746
03:06:26,439 --> 03:06:28,279
round they know the heroes are

4747
03:06:28,279 --> 03:06:29,600
positioned down bottom in particular

4748
03:06:29,600 --> 03:06:31,520
that nagas they know that chiro was down

4749
03:06:31,520 --> 03:06:35,239
here making the long wrap around you see

4750
03:06:35,239 --> 03:06:37,200
nothing to say for a second your a h the

4751
03:06:37,200 --> 03:06:39,200
jump straight away with the stun it's

4752
03:06:39,200 --> 03:06:41,000
far too much damage for nothing to say

4753
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:41,680
to

4754
03:06:41,680 --> 03:06:44,279
survive tofu and Ace menaces this game

4755
03:06:44,279 --> 03:06:47,000
tofu 5505 the instant bedum trusting his

4756
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,520
buddy

4757
03:06:50,040 --> 03:06:52,479
might be able to run into more too Shiro

4758
03:06:52,479 --> 03:06:55,239
he's been spotted Ace oh he knows which

4759
03:06:55,239 --> 03:06:56,760
one the real one get with the jump the

4760
03:06:56,760 --> 03:06:58,760
Illusions are out Sher going look to try

4761
03:06:58,760 --> 03:07:00,479
and turn to him with the fear pushing

4762
03:07:00,479 --> 03:07:02,359
back sherro for now means that Ace

4763
03:07:02,359 --> 03:07:03,399
doesn't have to worry about losing The

4764
03:07:03,399 --> 03:07:05,080
Reincarnation quite yet he's still got

4765
03:07:05,080 --> 03:07:06,520
that to protect himself and go for a

4766
03:07:06,520 --> 03:07:08,080
second round it will get forced out here

4767
03:07:08,080 --> 03:07:10,800
with splitter too deep forward new

4768
03:07:10,800 --> 03:07:12,399
looking for some skew Place 5 Seconds

4769
03:07:12,399 --> 03:07:14,960
till it's back

4770
03:07:15,520 --> 03:07:18,120
up we manag to clear out the make sure

4771
03:07:18,120 --> 03:07:20,160
there's no vision for lgd to play around

4772
03:07:20,160 --> 03:07:22,200
to try for that sort of jump so gaming

4773
03:07:22,200 --> 03:07:24,720
Gladiators will back off safely a cool

4774
03:07:24,720 --> 03:07:26,520
smoke thr from gaming they kind of force

4775
03:07:26,520 --> 03:07:28,239
lgd all the way back to their base

4776
03:07:28,239 --> 03:07:29,479
getting out of their jungle with that

4777
03:07:29,479 --> 03:07:32,560
one even while picking up a

4778
03:07:32,880 --> 03:07:35,640
kill and Shiro's Farm continues to roll

4779
03:07:35,640 --> 03:07:37,720
in very nicely still nice trying to get

4780
03:07:37,720 --> 03:07:39,160
this heart done on top of the man he's

4781
03:07:39,160 --> 03:07:40,960
closing in on it the only scare is that

4782
03:07:40,960 --> 03:07:42,520
the pengle just continues to have this

4783
03:07:42,520 --> 03:07:44,439
very very hard game same thing for the

4784
03:07:44,439 --> 03:07:46,800
Magnus and the Naga siren even at this

4785
03:07:46,800 --> 03:07:48,200
point like even if gets the ultimate

4786
03:07:48,200 --> 03:07:49,600
scaling all the way to the end of these

4787
03:07:49,600 --> 03:07:51,319
games is he able to carry versus all

4788
03:07:51,319 --> 03:07:53,720
this they have great late game but it's

4789
03:07:53,720 --> 03:07:55,880
an 8K lead already for the side of

4790
03:07:55,880 --> 03:07:57,279
gaming Gladiators they're getting crazy

4791
03:07:57,279 --> 03:07:58,760
scaling even on the supports as we were

4792
03:07:58,760 --> 03:08:00,560
mentioning I've been waiting to see what

4793
03:08:00,560 --> 03:08:02,160
tofu looks to queue up cuz he's having

4794
03:08:02,160 --> 03:08:04,080
such a good game the U scepter but he's

4795
03:08:04,080 --> 03:08:05,600
sitting on 12200 if he does want to look

4796
03:08:05,600 --> 03:08:08,399
to go down some scaling route

4797
03:08:08,399 --> 03:08:11,399
too and there's the pipe now for

4798
03:08:11,399 --> 03:08:13,720
celery more and more

4799
03:08:13,720 --> 03:08:15,920
tankiness when he's got the agony

4800
03:08:15,920 --> 03:08:17,760
finished up now too so much more

4801
03:08:17,760 --> 03:08:19,120
potential much better ways to be able to

4802
03:08:19,120 --> 03:08:21,200
clear out this nasar

4803
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:23,720
too as Ro potentially soon on the docket

4804
03:08:23,720 --> 03:08:27,200
here for gaming bkb finished up for

4805
03:08:27,200 --> 03:08:30,040
Dao and those last few attempts from lgd

4806
03:08:30,040 --> 03:08:31,840
they just haven't been able to take down

4807
03:08:31,840 --> 03:08:34,120
this queen of pain 100 to zero and

4808
03:08:34,120 --> 03:08:35,640
Shiro's gone for the full tanky route

4809
03:08:35,640 --> 03:08:37,200
rather than the aggressive route that we

4810
03:08:37,200 --> 03:08:38,920
sometimes do see from the nagas I think

4811
03:08:38,920 --> 03:08:40,200
sometimes we do see that like Orchid

4812
03:08:40,200 --> 03:08:41,640
kind of playmaking style come out but

4813
03:08:41,640 --> 03:08:43,479
shirro he's just trying to build up for

4814
03:08:43,479 --> 03:08:47,160
himself he spotted got eyes on you f the

4815
03:08:47,160 --> 03:08:48,720
TP is coming in as well see if he can

4816
03:08:48,720 --> 03:08:50,920
get the blink off in time no right cck

4817
03:08:50,920 --> 03:08:53,160
are there celer will catch him they drag

4818
03:08:53,160 --> 03:08:56,120
him back into the stun new punished here

4819
03:08:56,120 --> 03:08:57,720
for trying to farm this bottom half of

4820
03:08:57,720 --> 03:08:59,200
the map gaming Gladiators they'll be

4821
03:08:59,200 --> 03:09:01,439
having none of that kind of the name of

4822
03:09:01,439 --> 03:09:03,680
the game though for lgd paull pull

4823
03:09:03,680 --> 03:09:05,239
gaming away from their base try to buy

4824
03:09:05,239 --> 03:09:07,800
more and more time even though new does

4825
03:09:07,800 --> 03:09:09,640
die does force three Heroes to make the

4826
03:09:09,640 --> 03:09:12,080
move down

4827
03:09:14,319 --> 03:09:18,120
there up the RO now Ro now yep to grab

4828
03:09:18,120 --> 03:09:21,399
this ACE also very close to his own bkb

4829
03:09:21,399 --> 03:09:22,439
yeah and with that kill that they got

4830
03:09:22,439 --> 03:09:24,479
onto new I mean for lgd it's probably

4831
03:09:24,479 --> 03:09:25,920
too difficult for them to contest down

4832
03:09:25,920 --> 03:09:27,160
here anyway

4833
03:09:27,160 --> 03:09:29,640
but now it's guaranteed here for gaming

4834
03:09:29,640 --> 03:09:32,600
to be able to finish that one

4835
03:09:33,520 --> 03:09:36,239
off and tofu still considering his item

4836
03:09:36,239 --> 03:09:38,600
build 1700 gold he hasn't queued it up

4837
03:09:38,600 --> 03:09:39,680
I'm waiting to see which one he does

4838
03:09:39,680 --> 03:09:42,439
want to go down the route

4839
03:09:42,880 --> 03:09:45,200
of we shall

4840
03:09:45,200 --> 03:09:47,439
see que going for a little bit more

4841
03:09:47,439 --> 03:09:48,680
protection something you don't see too

4842
03:09:48,680 --> 03:09:50,640
often anymore on the queen of pain but

4843
03:09:50,640 --> 03:09:52,920
is buying a ules after having his Agony

4844
03:09:52,920 --> 03:09:54,399
and his Kaaya so just that little bit of

4845
03:09:54,399 --> 03:09:55,960
extra protection versus the calling in

4846
03:09:55,960 --> 03:09:58,960
particular could be

4847
03:09:59,120 --> 03:10:01,760
huge as with this agis imagine the game

4848
03:10:01,760 --> 03:10:03,080
is going to look to control the map a

4849
03:10:03,080 --> 03:10:04,720
lot more here try to constrict this

4850
03:10:04,720 --> 03:10:07,239
nagas from getting out shirro playing in

4851
03:10:07,239 --> 03:10:08,520
these dangerous positions trying to get

4852
03:10:08,520 --> 03:10:10,720
Farm in the enemy ancients and cutting

4853
03:10:10,720 --> 03:10:12,600
some waves nice micro coming out from

4854
03:10:12,600 --> 03:10:14,600
him just like we saw from that

4855
03:10:14,600 --> 03:10:16,720
Luna I mean honestly as long as he's

4856
03:10:16,720 --> 03:10:18,399
able to survive survive and stay alive

4857
03:10:18,399 --> 03:10:20,279
you can probably guarantee that two of

4858
03:10:20,279 --> 03:10:22,080
these waves at least will be held right

4859
03:10:22,080 --> 03:10:24,040
back onto gaming gladiator's half of the

4860
03:10:24,040 --> 03:10:25,439
map it's not going to be too easy for

4861
03:10:25,439 --> 03:10:27,200
them to get a push going towards

4862
03:10:27,200 --> 03:10:28,640
multiple Lanes at the same time

4863
03:10:28,640 --> 03:10:31,760
Gladiators with the play from

4864
03:10:31,880 --> 03:10:35,319
Shir as lgd smoked up want to try

4865
03:10:35,319 --> 03:10:37,080
something here with the RP once more qu

4866
03:10:37,080 --> 03:10:38,720
they're going to try it again this time

4867
03:10:38,720 --> 03:10:41,880
around do they have enough he got the

4868
03:10:41,880 --> 03:10:45,399
the out of there that's an RP down and a

4869
03:10:45,399 --> 03:10:47,359
splitter and that time they don't even

4870
03:10:47,359 --> 03:10:50,120
come close to killing him this your pick

4871
03:10:50,120 --> 03:10:51,920
up feels pretty damn beautiful there if

4872
03:10:51,920 --> 03:10:53,200
they don't have that chain Stone which

4873
03:10:53,200 --> 03:10:54,880
they really don't have with their draft

4874
03:10:54,880 --> 03:10:56,000
he's going to be able to get it off

4875
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:57,640
every time and he's going for kayange so

4876
03:10:57,640 --> 03:10:59,040
stus this is going to make it

4877
03:10:59,040 --> 03:11:00,279
potentially even easier for him to get

4878
03:11:00,279 --> 03:11:01,880
off afterwards in these later instances

4879
03:11:01,880 --> 03:11:02,960
pretty much the only way they can kill

4880
03:11:02,960 --> 03:11:04,880
this Quin a pain is if Quinn sort of

4881
03:11:04,880 --> 03:11:06,920
blinks into them but Quinn's not been

4882
03:11:06,920 --> 03:11:08,560
making those mistakes this game or if

4883
03:11:08,560 --> 03:11:09,880
they have absolutely everything that

4884
03:11:09,880 --> 03:11:11,520
comes in like perfectly with Shiro

4885
03:11:11,520 --> 03:11:12,680
though they need everybody hitting him

4886
03:11:12,680 --> 03:11:15,359
at the same time ult on cool down gaming

4887
03:11:15,359 --> 03:11:16,640
might look to make another move here

4888
03:11:16,640 --> 03:11:18,640
they see sh top I mean this is an

4889
03:11:18,640 --> 03:11:20,120
empowered nasar they're kind of giving

4890
03:11:20,120 --> 03:11:21,760
away which the real one is I mean and

4891
03:11:21,760 --> 03:11:23,399
they know that there's no RP and H knows

4892
03:11:23,399 --> 03:11:24,520
this is the real one I mean they're

4893
03:11:24,520 --> 03:11:25,800
already teing in onto the back lines as

4894
03:11:25,800 --> 03:11:27,319
well Shir is going to go for the song TP

4895
03:11:27,319 --> 03:11:30,120
out same to be said for while you smile

4896
03:11:30,120 --> 03:11:31,720
get out oh that was close though the

4897
03:11:31,720 --> 03:11:34,399
fear from tofu nearly catch in but lgd

4898
03:11:34,399 --> 03:11:36,399
will escape oh man if tofu's blink was

4899
03:11:36,399 --> 03:11:37,840
actually on him there that potentially

4900
03:11:37,840 --> 03:11:39,000
could have been a catch on to either one

4901
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:40,680
of these Heroes blink was coming on The

4902
03:11:40,680 --> 03:11:42,520
Courier for the willow so tofu he made

4903
03:11:42,520 --> 03:11:43,880
his decision what he wants to go for

4904
03:11:43,880 --> 03:11:45,680
this is a cool pickup too I feel this is

4905
03:11:45,680 --> 03:11:47,600
more about stopping it that initiation

4906
03:11:47,600 --> 03:11:48,920
or the counter initiation that lgd is

4907
03:11:48,920 --> 03:11:50,359
going for rather than scaling for

4908
03:11:50,359 --> 03:11:51,640
himself he's looking to see where this

4909
03:11:51,640 --> 03:11:53,479
RP comes blink get the fear off and

4910
03:11:53,479 --> 03:11:55,319
reset the fights for his team so a cool

4911
03:11:55,319 --> 03:11:58,520
choice if he's able to get those

4912
03:11:58,760 --> 03:12:00,840
catches how's nothing to sa his game

4913
03:12:00,840 --> 03:12:02,239
going I mean recovering slightly but

4914
03:12:02,239 --> 03:12:04,760
still 06 and zero hasn't been involved

4915
03:12:04,760 --> 03:12:06,760
in any sort of positive action this game

4916
03:12:06,760 --> 03:12:08,439
when it comes to kills it's been rough

4917
03:12:08,439 --> 03:12:10,359
he's tried but it's just been completely

4918
03:12:10,359 --> 03:12:12,040
stopped from Quinn every single time he

4919
03:12:12,040 --> 03:12:13,720
comes in a sonic wave just pushes him

4920
03:12:13,720 --> 03:12:15,520
back and stops him in his

4921
03:12:15,520 --> 03:12:18,439
tracks 81% as we see there right now for

4922
03:12:18,439 --> 03:12:21,359
gaming plus is liking their chances so

4923
03:12:21,359 --> 03:12:22,680
much weight right now on shir's

4924
03:12:22,680 --> 03:12:23,960
shoulders really feels like all of it's

4925
03:12:23,960 --> 03:12:25,040
going to be these big plays that he's

4926
03:12:25,040 --> 03:12:26,680
able to make with these Illusions assoon

4927
03:12:26,680 --> 03:12:28,160
having a butterfly so he is getting

4928
03:12:28,160 --> 03:12:29,800
quite

4929
03:12:29,800 --> 03:12:32,640
tanky but the rest of his

4930
03:12:32,640 --> 03:12:35,120
allies contining to be pretty poor

4931
03:12:35,120 --> 03:12:36,439
gaming they're scaling on all three

4932
03:12:36,439 --> 03:12:39,239
cores oh they really are they really are

4933
03:12:39,239 --> 03:12:40,800
a still holding the top spot out of the

4934
03:12:40,800 --> 03:12:42,680
team incredible Farm on this off flame

4935
03:12:42,680 --> 03:12:44,239
wraith

4936
03:12:44,239 --> 03:12:46,800
King just a blink the bkb going down the

4937
03:12:46,800 --> 03:12:48,640
or afterwards just to enable his

4938
03:12:48,640 --> 03:12:50,560
teammates even more

4939
03:12:50,560 --> 03:12:52,640
so and just keeping now they're starting

4940
03:12:52,640 --> 03:12:53,960
to keep more and more control of the map

4941
03:12:53,960 --> 03:12:55,279
after they got this AIS they're dealing

4942
03:12:55,279 --> 03:12:56,920
with all three lanes celery showing on

4943
03:12:56,920 --> 03:12:58,720
one lane Ace showing on another and

4944
03:12:58,720 --> 03:13:00,040
Quinn with the backup of two Heroes

4945
03:13:00,040 --> 03:13:01,359
showing on another one so they're

4946
03:13:01,359 --> 03:13:02,560
keeping the lane shoved in and

4947
03:13:02,560 --> 03:13:04,600
constricting shirro from getting his

4948
03:13:04,600 --> 03:13:06,040
Illusions actually out to cut these

4949
03:13:06,040 --> 03:13:07,560
waves he's actually been unable to for

4950
03:13:07,560 --> 03:13:10,040
the last few

4951
03:13:10,760 --> 03:13:13,319
minutes the fact that they R&D getting

4952
03:13:13,319 --> 03:13:14,800
the chance to hit these two tier tws at

4953
03:13:14,800 --> 03:13:17,520
the same time definitely a concern for

4954
03:13:17,520 --> 03:13:19,279
how lgd would want to be keeping this

4955
03:13:19,279 --> 03:13:20,840
game going and they can potentially even

4956
03:13:20,840 --> 03:13:22,279
set up a Tormentor if they'd like to

4957
03:13:22,279 --> 03:13:23,479
maybe a little bit of a risk playing

4958
03:13:23,479 --> 03:13:25,359
versus the Magnus and everything but Ace

4959
03:13:25,359 --> 03:13:27,439
may be thinking about

4960
03:13:27,439 --> 03:13:29,680
it did celer show what he's going to be

4961
03:13:29,680 --> 03:13:31,040
building just yet okay does have the

4962
03:13:31,040 --> 03:13:32,600
agony queued up we know he's going to be

4963
03:13:32,600 --> 03:13:34,680
a great

4964
03:13:34,680 --> 03:13:37,800
option look at this the Deep jump oh

4965
03:13:37,800 --> 03:13:39,560
he's going past the two three is ready

4966
03:13:39,560 --> 03:13:41,160
to sort of dive in a look for Action the

4967
03:13:41,160 --> 03:13:44,160
sleep is there RP as well two of them

4968
03:13:44,160 --> 03:13:46,239
it's going to bring them low up from

4969
03:13:46,239 --> 03:13:47,800
Quinn Quinn will be a jump out of this

4970
03:13:47,800 --> 03:13:49,479
one get to the side actually hits pretty

4971
03:13:49,479 --> 03:13:52,319
much a fight wave there a on the second

4972
03:13:52,319 --> 03:13:54,359
line goes towards the ET takes down y

4973
03:13:54,359 --> 03:13:56,680
you smile Shir has to use the S to back

4974
03:13:56,680 --> 03:13:58,279
up I mean what a jump there I mean

4975
03:13:58,279 --> 03:13:59,960
salary tping it aggressively and then

4976
03:13:59,960 --> 03:14:01,960
Ace jumping for just go straight for it

4977
03:14:01,960 --> 03:14:03,399
yeah Quinn gets a connection on almost

4978
03:14:03,399 --> 03:14:06,239
everybody withow pretty much a five

4979
03:14:06,239 --> 03:14:08,680
map just trying to use this AG just as

4980
03:14:08,680 --> 03:14:10,880
much as possible Dao 40 seconds left on

4981
03:14:10,880 --> 03:14:13,880
it he should be able to Prof it the once

4982
03:14:13,880 --> 03:14:15,680
maybe maybe not he's actually able to to

4983
03:14:15,680 --> 03:14:17,399
get out of this dire he's not even lose

4984
03:14:17,399 --> 03:14:20,040
the ages quite yet little toggle gets

4985
03:14:20,040 --> 03:14:21,800
himself out they force the glyph they

4986
03:14:21,800 --> 03:14:23,239
force quite a bit there I mean pretty

4987
03:14:23,239 --> 03:14:25,239
much every single ulti being used from

4988
03:14:25,239 --> 03:14:27,160
the side of lgd just to sustain and

4989
03:14:27,160 --> 03:14:29,840
withstand themselves celer does buy back

4990
03:14:29,840 --> 03:14:32,520
at the least there one silver lining for

4991
03:14:32,520 --> 03:14:35,120
lgd but gaming at any moment you can see

4992
03:14:35,120 --> 03:14:37,279
they're very confident just jumping

4993
03:14:37,279 --> 03:14:39,439
in

4994
03:14:39,439 --> 03:14:41,880
Dao the skew back on him 10 seconds to

4995
03:14:41,880 --> 03:14:43,120
lat

4996
03:14:43,120 --> 03:14:45,160
seconds and we just look to take him

4997
03:14:45,160 --> 03:14:46,760
down the first time whilst the ages is

4998
03:14:46,760 --> 03:14:49,279
still there and they get the torment to

4999
03:14:49,279 --> 03:14:50,840
qu go for round two Quinn he's in with

5000
03:14:50,840 --> 03:14:52,560
the Jump drao Plus the pkb turns over

5001
03:14:52,560 --> 03:14:55,560
toward the surrounded here in the corner

5002
03:14:55,560 --> 03:14:57,479
they came blocked off by the Rio son

5003
03:14:57,479 --> 03:14:58,960
wave as well he's pushed up to the side

5004
03:14:58,960 --> 03:15:00,840
of the mount Quinn jumps in he's killing

5005
03:15:00,840 --> 03:15:02,239
off the back lines he's taken out

5006
03:15:02,239 --> 03:15:04,880
blooded you a all as R the round of the

5007
03:15:04,880 --> 03:15:08,120
nasar and Shir he's out 50 seconds none

5008
03:15:08,120 --> 03:15:11,040
of them with by back gold available as

5009
03:15:11,040 --> 03:15:13,000
GG will be able to push down this bottom

5010
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:14,600
Lane maybe even get the tier three in

5011
03:15:14,600 --> 03:15:15,680
the barracks with this one they're

5012
03:15:15,680 --> 03:15:17,520
starting to fall a bit long Quinn

5013
03:15:17,520 --> 03:15:20,760
but Dao's he's full HP he's back to for

5014
03:15:20,760 --> 03:15:22,199
Quinn I mean what can they do to push

5015
03:15:22,199 --> 03:15:23,560
this one back at at least they's still a

5016
03:15:23,560 --> 03:15:25,399
tier two in the mid lane they don't have

5017
03:15:25,399 --> 03:15:27,080
their Magnus they have no way to skewer

5018
03:15:27,080 --> 03:15:29,160
no way to hold this off this RX looking

5019
03:15:29,160 --> 03:15:31,479
pretty dead can they stop

5020
03:15:31,479 --> 03:15:34,239
this I Quinn this Arcane Rune right

5021
03:15:34,239 --> 03:15:36,680
there coming into play and now Ace

5022
03:15:36,680 --> 03:15:39,080
nothing to say going to try and put a

5023
03:15:39,080 --> 03:15:40,680
bit of a slow down to this push but at

5024
03:15:40,680 --> 03:15:42,239
the same time he's going to make sure

5025
03:15:42,239 --> 03:15:43,600
that he keeps a fair bit of a distance

5026
03:15:43,600 --> 03:15:44,840
when the Rolling Thunder does comes to

5027
03:15:44,840 --> 03:15:46,439
an end I mean they're still going even

5028
03:15:46,439 --> 03:15:48,800
for the melee Rex here gaming Gladiators

5029
03:15:48,800 --> 03:15:50,720
pushing the limits will be backing up

5030
03:15:50,720 --> 03:15:52,520
Magnus is respawning RP's back up

5031
03:15:52,520 --> 03:15:55,239
they'll give respect but another massive

5032
03:15:55,239 --> 03:15:57,800
hit 13k lead they bring down shiron and

5033
03:15:57,800 --> 03:15:59,399
Quinn with the back of that Arcane Rune

5034
03:15:59,399 --> 03:16:00,920
kind of making the magic happen The

5035
03:16:00,920 --> 03:16:02,840
Confident blink forward into everybody I

5036
03:16:02,840 --> 03:16:04,560
mean he knows they can't kill him yep

5037
03:16:04,560 --> 03:16:06,279
now his itemization feels absolutely

5038
03:16:06,279 --> 03:16:08,040
perfect this game and he knows it he's

5039
03:16:08,040 --> 03:16:09,199
playing so

5040
03:16:09,199 --> 03:16:11,520
confident full heart now on the CK as

5041
03:16:11,520 --> 03:16:14,160
well too a massive hit from

5042
03:16:14,160 --> 03:16:16,479
gaming and everything coming back up for

5043
03:16:16,479 --> 03:16:19,920
the pretty soon sonic wave 15

5044
03:16:19,920 --> 03:16:22,560
seconds it's just been so hard for LGT

5045
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:25,399
to really find a a kill at all yep I

5046
03:16:25,399 --> 03:16:26,680
mean as soon as the song gets used they

5047
03:16:26,680 --> 03:16:27,920
kind of just have to like reset and run

5048
03:16:27,920 --> 03:16:29,399
and then once Shir gets isolated without

5049
03:16:29,399 --> 03:16:31,160
song He's just dead they have no way to

5050
03:16:31,160 --> 03:16:34,000
follow up to protect

5051
03:16:36,359 --> 03:16:38,920
him Quinn soon to have a shivas as well

5052
03:16:38,920 --> 03:16:40,399
to more and more layers for them to try

5053
03:16:40,399 --> 03:16:44,680
to get through to bring down this quad

5054
03:16:47,840 --> 03:16:49,239
trying to step out of their base a

5055
03:16:49,239 --> 03:16:51,720
little bit lgd

5056
03:16:51,720 --> 03:16:54,560
but scary to come

5057
03:16:54,560 --> 03:16:56,680
out they keep having to just follow each

5058
03:16:56,680 --> 03:16:58,520
other together they have to play as a

5059
03:16:58,520 --> 03:17:00,199
unit here versus the side of gaming they

5060
03:17:00,199 --> 03:17:01,600
can just get picked up in an instant as

5061
03:17:01,600 --> 03:17:03,640
we see there gaming no hesitation to

5062
03:17:03,640 --> 03:17:06,439
jump if a hero's

5063
03:17:07,319 --> 03:17:09,199
isolated they find something with this

5064
03:17:09,199 --> 03:17:12,399
smoke Quinn he's got a shield run they

5065
03:17:12,399 --> 03:17:14,760
try for the skewer back hesitations of

5066
03:17:14,760 --> 03:17:15,840
course they they don't want to drop the

5067
03:17:15,840 --> 03:17:17,640
RP because the last few times it's just

5068
03:17:17,640 --> 03:17:19,239
not worked out I mean even if they get

5069
03:17:19,239 --> 03:17:20,720
him there honestly he just probably pops

5070
03:17:20,720 --> 03:17:22,160
Shield R and will fly see the same thing

5071
03:17:22,160 --> 03:17:25,439
that happened time and timeing

5072
03:17:26,199 --> 03:17:29,080
before three lanes being shoved in you

5073
03:17:29,080 --> 03:17:30,479
see the lines being drawn from lgd

5074
03:17:30,479 --> 03:17:33,960
they're like we need to get these Lanes

5075
03:17:37,120 --> 03:17:38,960
out

5076
03:17:38,960 --> 03:17:42,120
tooing for the very aggressive play

5077
03:17:42,120 --> 03:17:44,800
here for the jump jump Shiro he's got

5078
03:17:44,800 --> 03:17:47,040
backup get glimmered

5079
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:49,239
instant play I mean why you smile in the

5080
03:17:49,239 --> 03:17:51,680
perfect position there to protect him

5081
03:17:51,680 --> 03:17:53,000
more and more items to deal with that

5082
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:54,600
Naga you said you know the radiance is

5083
03:17:54,600 --> 03:17:56,319
out the AC's out for Ace great items

5084
03:17:56,319 --> 03:17:58,399
versus Naga now shivas of course coming

5085
03:17:58,399 --> 03:18:00,640
out for Quinn harder and harder for

5086
03:18:00,640 --> 03:18:03,720
shirro to Solo Carry

5087
03:18:05,199 --> 03:18:08,359
this all three lanes shoved in no space

5088
03:18:08,359 --> 03:18:10,399
for Shiro to get out on the map should

5089
03:18:10,399 --> 03:18:12,080
be able to take out this final tier two

5090
03:18:12,080 --> 03:18:14,800
tower now gaming Gladiators and R it's

5091
03:18:14,800 --> 03:18:17,560
going to be a long spawn Ace jumps in he

5092
03:18:17,560 --> 03:18:18,560
goes straight forward straight over

5093
03:18:18,560 --> 03:18:19,680
towards planet that will be the glimmer

5094
03:18:19,680 --> 03:18:20,479
again to try and get him out of there

5095
03:18:20,479 --> 03:18:22,040
butel with the TP PS up to The High

5096
03:18:22,040 --> 03:18:23,279
Ground Planet he's been caught by the

5097
03:18:23,279 --> 03:18:24,520
Sprout they get the skew back on the

5098
03:18:24,520 --> 03:18:26,560
celery C caught by the Sun as they take

5099
03:18:26,560 --> 03:18:28,160
the Nature's profit down but the sonic

5100
03:18:28,160 --> 03:18:30,359
wave from Quinn Clips planet look how

5101
03:18:30,359 --> 03:18:31,560
confident he is with the shield Rune

5102
03:18:31,560 --> 03:18:33,479
knows they have no way to get him celery

5103
03:18:33,479 --> 03:18:35,520
does die and that was the dieback so 60

5104
03:18:35,520 --> 03:18:37,439
seconds without him gaming looks like

5105
03:18:37,439 --> 03:18:38,600
they will be happy with that tier two

5106
03:18:38,600 --> 03:18:39,960
and that kill they back up and get that

5107
03:18:39,960 --> 03:18:42,760
farm going here DD spawns up top and

5108
03:18:42,760 --> 03:18:44,160
Quinn gets one of those big talents with

5109
03:18:44,160 --> 03:18:48,720
the agony's build he's got the 20 Talent

5110
03:18:50,800 --> 03:18:53,040
long spawn on that Rush maybe a

5111
03:18:53,040 --> 03:18:54,680
fortunate one for lgd it feels like a

5112
03:18:54,680 --> 03:18:56,520
little bit but either way they have more

5113
03:18:56,520 --> 03:18:57,720
than enough time on the side of gaming

5114
03:18:57,720 --> 03:18:59,239
to just keep these Lanes shoved in to

5115
03:18:59,239 --> 03:19:01,800
constrict

5116
03:19:03,720 --> 03:19:06,800
Jiro scaling continues we are going to

5117
03:19:06,800 --> 03:19:08,439
be able to listen in on bleed gaming

5118
03:19:08,439 --> 03:19:09,920
gladia to see what they had to say about

5119
03:19:09,920 --> 03:19:12,279
those previous

5120
03:19:12,279 --> 03:19:14,319
moments if we play in formation they

5121
03:19:14,319 --> 03:19:15,760
have no chance of fighting we just do

5122
03:19:15,760 --> 03:19:17,080
not overreach the only way they can kill

5123
03:19:17,080 --> 03:19:20,279
us if we get like Ultra scared into

5124
03:19:20,279 --> 03:19:23,279
combo yep I mean he's absolutely right

5125
03:19:23,279 --> 03:19:24,720
on that one we're seeing it the way that

5126
03:19:24,720 --> 03:19:26,120
the gaming Gladiators are moving as a

5127
03:19:26,120 --> 03:19:28,479
unit it's just not allowing lgd any

5128
03:19:28,479 --> 03:19:30,840
opportunity to to get the jump on not to

5129
03:19:30,840 --> 03:19:32,239
get the jump on multi- Heroes too right

5130
03:19:32,239 --> 03:19:34,640
we've seen one man RPS one man skewers

5131
03:19:34,640 --> 03:19:36,560
one man Splitters just God gaming they

5132
03:19:36,560 --> 03:19:37,439
really have not been giving the

5133
03:19:37,439 --> 03:19:38,800
opportunities to them to get that big

5134
03:19:38,800 --> 03:19:41,199
womo combo onto multiple Heroes full hex

5135
03:19:41,199 --> 03:19:43,560
now on to Shiro a little bit more catch

5136
03:19:43,560 --> 03:19:47,840
to potentially trip up Quinn

5137
03:19:48,640 --> 03:19:50,760
he he's really got his work cut out Shir

5138
03:19:50,760 --> 03:19:52,160
really does he's had the chance to get

5139
03:19:52,160 --> 03:19:55,080
the farm but can can he do what's

5140
03:19:55,080 --> 03:19:57,840
necessary to keep lgd's hopes alive here

5141
03:19:57,840 --> 03:20:02,640
in this game too it really is all up to

5142
03:20:03,080 --> 03:20:06,439
him Ro 30 seconds gaming positioning

5143
03:20:06,439 --> 03:20:07,520
themselves for

5144
03:20:07,520 --> 03:20:10,439
it all four five Heroes actually set up

5145
03:20:10,439 --> 03:20:12,680
down bottom Daio getting closer and

5146
03:20:12,680 --> 03:20:14,479
closer to his mkb to be able to focus

5147
03:20:14,479 --> 03:20:18,279
down this nagar as well

5148
03:20:18,279 --> 03:20:20,239
Ace almost has an agon so even if they

5149
03:20:20,239 --> 03:20:21,840
do get caught in some type of Wombo

5150
03:20:21,840 --> 03:20:23,040
Combo and stuff like that there's the

5151
03:20:23,040 --> 03:20:24,359
plays around

5152
03:20:24,359 --> 03:20:27,720
it more and more scaling continues

5153
03:20:27,720 --> 03:20:29,760
Ro

5154
03:20:29,760 --> 03:20:32,160
lgd is a tough call to make but maybe

5155
03:20:32,160 --> 03:20:33,319
they might feel like they have to

5156
03:20:33,319 --> 03:20:35,160
potentially try to contest this Roshan

5157
03:20:35,160 --> 03:20:37,199
but yeah this it's a very very hard call

5158
03:20:37,199 --> 03:20:39,120
to make I mean and gaming Gladiators

5159
03:20:39,120 --> 03:20:40,000
they're going to be coming straight for

5160
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:43,120
them first smoke

5161
03:20:45,640 --> 03:20:48,520
gladi this could be totally unexpected

5162
03:20:48,520 --> 03:20:50,399
here they're going to be ready to head

5163
03:20:50,399 --> 03:20:52,840
into the triangle Dao leading the charge

5164
03:20:52,840 --> 03:20:55,560
scouted by a tree blink link is there in

5165
03:20:55,560 --> 03:20:58,479
time nicely

5166
03:21:00,960 --> 03:21:04,680
done and they will all get

5167
03:21:06,760 --> 03:21:09,359
out s will back up deal with the lanes

5168
03:21:09,359 --> 03:21:11,720
as his team goes for the RO super close

5169
03:21:11,720 --> 03:21:14,080
to his own

5170
03:21:14,840 --> 03:21:17,000
Agony me this item is always is super

5171
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:18,279
nice just so you don't have to really

5172
03:21:18,279 --> 03:21:20,359
like commit your hero so far he just

5173
03:21:20,359 --> 03:21:22,120
throws a Wrath of nature cuz it disarms

5174
03:21:22,120 --> 03:21:23,640
as well too all the bounces that it gets

5175
03:21:23,640 --> 03:21:25,359
on with the route so can be really nice

5176
03:21:25,359 --> 03:21:26,720
to just protect the heroes if they do

5177
03:21:26,720 --> 03:21:28,840
get caught inside of a big womo combo as

5178
03:21:28,840 --> 03:21:31,960
Ro will

5179
03:21:34,199 --> 03:21:36,840
fall Tacho can play a little bit more I

5180
03:21:36,840 --> 03:21:37,800
mean not say a little bit more

5181
03:21:37,800 --> 03:21:40,160
aggressive but more

5182
03:21:40,160 --> 03:21:42,760
aggressively and Quin a secondary life

5183
03:21:42,760 --> 03:21:44,560
has yet to die this game I mean they're

5184
03:21:44,560 --> 03:21:45,840
heading towards him top there's still a

5185
03:21:45,840 --> 03:21:47,479
tier one available here for backup to

5186
03:21:47,479 --> 03:21:49,239
come in if if they do want to dive this

5187
03:21:49,239 --> 03:21:50,880
but it's a CK with an

5188
03:21:50,880 --> 03:21:53,359
AIS try and te something out they'll get

5189
03:21:53,359 --> 03:21:56,880
the bkb response but nothing

5190
03:21:56,880 --> 03:21:59,239
more Tacho seems like he knew that was

5191
03:21:59,239 --> 03:22:02,000
coming from a mile

5192
03:22:04,279 --> 03:22:07,239
awayer wisdom runes double grab double

5193
03:22:07,239 --> 03:22:09,720
grabed again for gam lgd looking to try

5194
03:22:09,720 --> 03:22:11,279
to keep getting something up out of top

5195
03:22:11,279 --> 03:22:12,319
here but the lanes are starting to get

5196
03:22:12,319 --> 03:22:13,920
pushed in it is a lot of them out here

5197
03:22:13,920 --> 03:22:16,640
pretty deep on on the map but can can

5198
03:22:16,640 --> 03:22:18,439
they really start a fight

5199
03:22:18,439 --> 03:22:20,439
Planet able to get the Pierce the Veil

5200
03:22:20,439 --> 03:22:22,000
off little bit of protection but still

5201
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:23,479
the damage really coming in gr the

5202
03:22:23,479 --> 03:22:25,319
magical bringing him down low he's

5203
03:22:25,319 --> 03:22:27,000
caught in the trees Quin finishes him

5204
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:29,000
off lgd they've got to get out of there

5205
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:30,760
nice Ward from tofu quickly places that

5206
03:22:30,760 --> 03:22:33,359
one down on the

5207
03:22:33,479 --> 03:22:35,640
side tofu also still just having this

5208
03:22:35,640 --> 03:22:38,000
flawless game 5 Z on eight it's enabled

5209
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:41,000
Quinn to be able to snowball how many ad

5210
03:22:41,000 --> 03:22:43,080
spawns bottom Ace able to grab this one

5211
03:22:43,080 --> 03:22:44,239
now

5212
03:22:44,239 --> 03:22:48,439
too that Agony is done

5213
03:22:50,160 --> 03:22:51,640
and they can play like this just sort of

5214
03:22:51,640 --> 03:22:54,359
split across the map knowing that lgd

5215
03:22:54,359 --> 03:22:56,680
just can't really jump any of them and

5216
03:22:56,680 --> 03:22:57,880
if they do there's going to be more than

5217
03:22:57,880 --> 03:22:59,600
enough time for for them to survive long

5218
03:22:59,600 --> 03:23:01,359
enough for backup to arrive yeah they've

5219
03:23:01,359 --> 03:23:03,040
got all this itemization to to deal with

5220
03:23:03,040 --> 03:23:04,840
this nasar and as also of course didn't

5221
03:23:04,840 --> 03:23:06,199
point it out but he did get blessed with

5222
03:23:06,199 --> 03:23:07,760
the cloak of flames on top of everything

5223
03:23:07,760 --> 03:23:09,239
too so cloak of flames radiant so he's

5224
03:23:09,239 --> 03:23:10,199
going to be amazing versus these

5225
03:23:10,199 --> 03:23:12,239
illusion Heroes on top of qun having the

5226
03:23:12,239 --> 03:23:13,760
shivas and everything too and having

5227
03:23:13,760 --> 03:23:18,120
clal CL look how many of them they have

5228
03:23:18,560 --> 03:23:19,880
yeah these Lanes they're just constantly

5229
03:23:19,880 --> 03:23:22,279
being dealt with on top of the wrath of

5230
03:23:22,279 --> 03:23:24,080
nature of course brooding once you get

5231
03:23:24,080 --> 03:23:25,359
that Agony is the cool down also

5232
03:23:25,359 --> 03:23:27,239
dropping down to that 60 seconds he can

5233
03:23:27,239 --> 03:23:28,439
just throw it off cool down keep these

5234
03:23:28,439 --> 03:23:30,680
Lanes constantly shoved in keep lgd

5235
03:23:30,680 --> 03:23:33,239
inside of their base Quinn now with the

5236
03:23:33,239 --> 03:23:35,080
Lincoln as well to another layer to try

5237
03:23:35,080 --> 03:23:36,399
to go through they're just never going

5238
03:23:36,399 --> 03:23:39,040
to catch him nope doesn't feel like it

5239
03:23:39,040 --> 03:23:40,239
not with the way that he's played I mean

5240
03:23:40,239 --> 03:23:41,760
honestly it's been pretty much zero

5241
03:23:41,760 --> 03:23:43,760
mistakes from him so far Quinn a

5242
03:23:43,760 --> 03:23:46,160
Flawless game a Flawless two games to be

5243
03:23:46,160 --> 03:23:48,680
honest with

5244
03:23:49,160 --> 03:23:52,120
you lgd they're going to try it for it

5245
03:23:52,120 --> 03:23:53,680
again smoke

5246
03:23:53,680 --> 03:23:55,800
up they've got to take some sort of

5247
03:23:55,800 --> 03:23:58,359
highrisk plays here to try and pull this

5248
03:23:58,359 --> 03:23:59,800
game back in their favor who do you want

5249
03:23:59,800 --> 03:24:01,439
to go for though there's an Agony for a

5250
03:24:01,439 --> 03:24:03,080
king as well too these tanky front line

5251
03:24:03,080 --> 03:24:04,920
with AIS cheese too and Ace is just

5252
03:24:04,920 --> 03:24:06,399
walking he might just even blink in he's

5253
03:24:06,399 --> 03:24:09,560
taunting them he wants him to go for him

5254
03:24:09,560 --> 03:24:11,399
he's going to jump let's start off and

5255
03:24:11,399 --> 03:24:12,720
see they turn with the hex if they can

5256
03:24:12,720 --> 03:24:13,840
bring him down the once they get the

5257
03:24:13,840 --> 03:24:15,960
drive back up towards the tier three to

5258
03:24:15,960 --> 03:24:18,479
the base take him down once see as they

5259
03:24:18,479 --> 03:24:20,120
can do it a second time Quinn starts to

5260
03:24:20,120 --> 03:24:22,040
jump for get the shadow strike out on

5261
03:24:22,040 --> 03:24:24,640
New it's enough to hold them back and

5262
03:24:24,640 --> 03:24:26,920
indeed there's not any sort of attempt

5263
03:24:26,920 --> 03:24:29,319
from lgd to try and go on Ace a second

5264
03:24:29,319 --> 03:24:33,640
time 60 seconds we'll be back

5265
03:24:34,600 --> 03:24:36,960
up pretty much all wave starting to push

5266
03:24:36,960 --> 03:24:39,359
in against

5267
03:24:45,040 --> 03:24:47,120
lgd minutes

5268
03:24:47,120 --> 03:24:49,960
just under big neutrals found pent Edge

5269
03:24:49,960 --> 03:24:51,840
now for him as well after this mkb he is

5270
03:24:51,840 --> 03:24:54,120
hitting incredibly hard Quinn also finds

5271
03:24:54,120 --> 03:24:56,359
himself a storm crafter and Ace a Havoc

5272
03:24:56,359 --> 03:24:58,000
Hammer more really good items versus

5273
03:24:58,000 --> 03:25:00,560
pretty much all these

5274
03:25:03,319 --> 03:25:06,239
Illusions it's rare to see the nagas

5275
03:25:06,239 --> 03:25:07,720
unable to really send the Illusions out

5276
03:25:07,720 --> 03:25:08,960
to try to get any Farm but they're just

5277
03:25:08,960 --> 03:25:10,399
dealing with them so quickly every time

5278
03:25:10,399 --> 03:25:11,880
they see

5279
03:25:11,880 --> 03:25:15,319
them leaving the base just just does not

5280
03:25:15,319 --> 03:25:16,600
feel like an option right now now for

5281
03:25:16,600 --> 03:25:18,520
lgd whatsoever getting massively

5282
03:25:18,520 --> 03:25:23,199
outarmed the Gaming's farming 90% of the

5283
03:25:23,199 --> 03:25:25,600
map we heard it in the coms earlier just

5284
03:25:25,600 --> 03:25:27,800
sort of keeping everything very calm on

5285
03:25:27,800 --> 03:25:30,600
gaming Gladiators Dro clipped by the

5286
03:25:30,600 --> 03:25:31,840
Harpoon they're able to pull him in but

5287
03:25:31,840 --> 03:25:34,279
Quinn's here with a back up they get the

5288
03:25:34,279 --> 03:25:35,840
push back on to the three of them the RP

5289
03:25:35,840 --> 03:25:37,000
is there but it looks like it doesn't

5290
03:25:37,000 --> 03:25:38,319
really matter they've already lost

5291
03:25:38,319 --> 03:25:40,199
planet Shir having to use the song to

5292
03:25:40,199 --> 03:25:42,439
reset it's another Retreat from lgd they

5293
03:25:42,439 --> 03:25:43,920
can't even hold around the barracks as

5294
03:25:43,920 --> 03:25:45,720
the melee Barracks will fall is that

5295
03:25:45,720 --> 03:25:47,560
another for man sonic wave I feel like

5296
03:25:47,560 --> 03:25:49,120
from quid I feel like every single time

5297
03:25:49,120 --> 03:25:50,920
he's getting so many of these Heroes I

5298
03:25:50,920 --> 03:25:52,279
can't imagine what his damage in this in

5299
03:25:52,279 --> 03:25:54,040
this game but it probably is by far the

5300
03:25:54,040 --> 03:25:56,520
highest and Ace going again he's going

5301
03:25:56,520 --> 03:25:57,640
up towards the tier four they get

5302
03:25:57,640 --> 03:25:58,600
another round of the Shadow strike

5303
03:25:58,600 --> 03:25:59,880
daggers out into the two of them sh

5304
03:25:59,880 --> 03:26:02,040
trying to step forward the Illusions out

5305
03:26:02,040 --> 03:26:03,840
but drao pretty much ignoring them

5306
03:26:03,840 --> 03:26:06,279
hitting onto the tier C with the Sun a

5307
03:26:06,279 --> 03:26:07,520
stepping forward they get the pull back

5308
03:26:07,520 --> 03:26:09,279
with the rift Shiro's in trouble the hex

5309
03:26:09,279 --> 03:26:11,800
is there thrown down ons dire not enough

5310
03:26:11,800 --> 03:26:15,399
to to save shirro taken out short of the

5311
03:26:15,399 --> 03:26:17,760
money on buback you also to fall they

5312
03:26:17,760 --> 03:26:19,479
don't have to buy back here lgd is

5313
03:26:19,479 --> 03:26:21,600
gaming Gladiators taking them down one

5314
03:26:21,600 --> 03:26:23,800
by one St over the walls nothing to say

5315
03:26:23,800 --> 03:26:27,160
he's also out without no the exposed

5316
03:26:27,160 --> 03:26:29,920
they're looking to close it's over GG is

5317
03:26:29,920 --> 03:26:32,840
gone gaming Gladiators take this one two

5318
03:26:32,840 --> 03:26:35,399
will be moving on to the Grand finals

5319
03:26:35,399 --> 03:26:37,600
what a display of dominance this last

5320
03:26:37,600 --> 03:26:39,880
pick queen of p i mean this seemed

5321
03:26:39,880 --> 03:26:42,120
perfect Quinn just took over everything

5322
03:26:42,120 --> 03:26:46,600
nothing to say ends the game 07 and zero

5323
03:26:46,600 --> 03:26:48,680
that has got to be one of the most

5324
03:26:48,680 --> 03:26:51,199
brutal mid comparisons we've seen I

5325
03:26:51,199 --> 03:26:53,680
think Quinn just letting out his disgust

5326
03:26:53,680 --> 03:26:56,720
for Pango Pickers big time in this game

5327
03:26:56,720 --> 03:26:59,359
with how dominant and how just rough

5328
03:26:59,359 --> 03:27:00,840
that mid match up ends up looking on the

5329
03:27:00,840 --> 03:27:02,359
scoreboard F I mean look at the damage

5330
03:27:02,359 --> 03:27:03,760
numbers it tells the tale of it all

5331
03:27:03,760 --> 03:27:06,520
Quinn look at this I mean ridiculous

5332
03:27:06,520 --> 03:27:08,920
36,000 how many fourman SS can we see

5333
03:27:08,920 --> 03:27:10,439
how many times is he just going to stop

5334
03:27:10,439 --> 03:27:12,040
nothing to say in his tracks in the

5335
03:27:12,040 --> 03:27:13,560
rolling Thunders nothing to say did

5336
03:27:13,560 --> 03:27:15,880
11,000 damage lgd tries to play for the

5337
03:27:15,880 --> 03:27:17,720
lake game but it doesn't even matter

5338
03:27:17,720 --> 03:27:19,600
gaming just controls everything and even

5339
03:27:19,600 --> 03:27:21,479
if it gets to these later stages they

5340
03:27:21,479 --> 03:27:22,920
had full grasp I mean they look

5341
03:27:22,920 --> 03:27:24,760
brilliant I mean as we said we we knew

5342
03:27:24,760 --> 03:27:26,760
it from the Dao def at the neutrals that

5343
03:27:26,760 --> 03:27:28,520
this game was over they always win the

5344
03:27:28,520 --> 03:27:30,760
games like that it's a crucial point I

5345
03:27:30,760 --> 03:27:32,040
mean you know from that point on she

5346
03:27:32,040 --> 03:27:33,640
just not beating them you know dero he's

5347
03:27:33,640 --> 03:27:35,479
in full Duro form and he does not get

5348
03:27:35,479 --> 03:27:37,560
stopped no he does not a Flawless game

5349
03:27:37,560 --> 03:27:39,239
from gaming Gladiators absolutely I mean

5350
03:27:39,239 --> 03:27:41,239
LG they had a great run but here today

5351
03:27:41,239 --> 03:27:42,640
they get shut down out of the

5352
03:27:42,640 --> 03:27:45,040
competition by Gaming Gladiators who are

5353
03:27:45,040 --> 03:27:46,319
going to be moving onto that ground

5354
03:27:46,319 --> 03:27:48,720
finals with an incredible Force after

5355
03:27:48,720 --> 03:27:50,760
the sort of ferocity that they win these

5356
03:27:50,760 --> 03:27:52,920
two games with gaming Gladiators they'll

5357
03:27:52,920 --> 03:27:55,439
take the series 20-0 against lgd and are

5358
03:27:55,439 --> 03:27:57,399
going to the Grand

5359
03:27:57,399 --> 03:28:01,040
finals a dominant showing from this team

5360
03:28:01,040 --> 03:28:02,640
they have made it all the way from the

5361
03:28:02,640 --> 03:28:05,199
first lower bracket round and now

5362
03:28:05,199 --> 03:28:07,399
they're going to be playing in the grand

5363
03:28:07,399 --> 03:28:09,640
finals in a short time they have a

5364
03:28:09,640 --> 03:28:11,319
little bit of time to reset and we have

5365
03:28:11,319 --> 03:28:13,279
some time to break down this series to

5366
03:28:13,279 --> 03:28:15,920
talk about game number two because Naga

5367
03:28:15,920 --> 03:28:17,880
could could have done work Gunner we saw

5368
03:28:17,880 --> 03:28:19,279
the pick coming we thought it was a

5369
03:28:19,279 --> 03:28:21,120
great counter pick but the game never

5370
03:28:21,120 --> 03:28:23,080
progressed to a point where she had map

5371
03:28:23,080 --> 03:28:25,479
to farm where she could do anything yeah

5372
03:28:25,479 --> 03:28:27,000
I think the Quinn queen of pain kind of

5373
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:29,239
popped off yeah massively nothing to say

5374
03:28:29,239 --> 03:28:30,720
had a really rough time in the mid lane

5375
03:28:30,720 --> 03:28:33,840
and uh Quinn just showing the mid diff

5376
03:28:33,840 --> 03:28:34,880
uh he's kind of shown that the entire

5377
03:28:34,880 --> 03:28:36,160
lower bracker run I think every game

5378
03:28:36,160 --> 03:28:37,800
they play it pretty much ends up being

5379
03:28:37,800 --> 03:28:39,319
Quinn just destroys the lane and they

5380
03:28:39,319 --> 03:28:40,359
just snowball it throughout the whole

5381
03:28:40,359 --> 03:28:42,160
game he took that Pango pick personally

5382
03:28:42,160 --> 03:28:44,560
for sure he did I mean tomato also did s

5383
03:28:44,560 --> 03:28:46,640
for rotations right because tofu coming

5384
03:28:46,640 --> 03:28:48,840
here to the mid lane twice and I mean

5385
03:28:48,840 --> 03:28:50,800
this death from the r was just hilarious

5386
03:28:50,800 --> 03:28:52,720
but anyways like coming mid twice and

5387
03:28:52,720 --> 03:28:54,800
like making that insane Advantage from

5388
03:28:54,800 --> 03:28:56,479
the mid lane starting and like TN he

5389
03:28:56,479 --> 03:28:58,080
never died like this game he played

5390
03:28:58,080 --> 03:29:00,080
perfectly and he was doing so much work

5391
03:29:00,080 --> 03:29:01,640
in these fights like we thought Naga

5392
03:29:01,640 --> 03:29:03,600
would be a problem but with the way he

5393
03:29:03,600 --> 03:29:06,239
played and how how much he was like

5394
03:29:06,239 --> 03:29:08,199
scaling and like how many items did he

5395
03:29:08,199 --> 03:29:10,960
get like this Naga was not even even be

5396
03:29:10,960 --> 03:29:13,359
able to do anything in this game and all

5397
03:29:13,359 --> 03:29:14,760
their Heroes allow them to keep pushing

5398
03:29:14,760 --> 03:29:17,199
their advantage so so hard like you have

5399
03:29:17,199 --> 03:29:19,080
a wraith King like you want to W King

5400
03:29:19,080 --> 03:29:20,279
can be quite squishy when he's on the

5401
03:29:20,279 --> 03:29:21,479
back foot right but when you're ahead

5402
03:29:21,479 --> 03:29:23,120
you're able to use those two lives to

5403
03:29:23,120 --> 03:29:24,720
front for your team using Nature's

5404
03:29:24,720 --> 03:29:26,399
profet Tri to scout everywhere you're

5405
03:29:26,399 --> 03:29:27,800
checking back in your own jungle to make

5406
03:29:27,800 --> 03:29:29,399
sure lgd aren't trying to farm there

5407
03:29:29,399 --> 03:29:30,920
you're scouting into the enemy jungle to

5408
03:29:30,920 --> 03:29:32,520
find people to gank and kill like you're

5409
03:29:32,520 --> 03:29:33,880
able to just keep going and going and

5410
03:29:33,880 --> 03:29:35,120
going and in the moments where they

5411
03:29:35,120 --> 03:29:36,239
thought they might have had something

5412
03:29:36,239 --> 03:29:37,640
suddenly gaming are up an item they have

5413
03:29:37,640 --> 03:29:39,640
a bkb queen of Pain's able to use her Al

5414
03:29:39,640 --> 03:29:42,040
to maybe rebuff the Pango uh you know

5415
03:29:42,040 --> 03:29:44,359
ultimate like they have so many tools

5416
03:29:44,359 --> 03:29:46,359
from this lead early to just allow them

5417
03:29:46,359 --> 03:29:48,120
to Stomp the game mean there's also

5418
03:29:48,120 --> 03:29:49,600
these little things that celer does

5419
03:29:49,600 --> 03:29:50,960
right you don't notice it in game but

5420
03:29:50,960 --> 03:29:53,239
he's like blocking the spawns with the

5421
03:29:53,239 --> 03:29:55,120
trees like you newr games and like

5422
03:29:55,120 --> 03:29:57,479
denying all the farm from lgd side too

5423
03:29:57,479 --> 03:29:59,120
like those little things that he's doing

5424
03:29:59,120 --> 03:30:01,040
on the sumon heroes are like very

5425
03:30:01,040 --> 03:30:03,840
Flawless as well we heard a little bit

5426
03:30:03,840 --> 03:30:05,680
of comments as well throughout this game

5427
03:30:05,680 --> 03:30:06,960
Quinn was making the call he said let's

5428
03:30:06,960 --> 03:30:08,520
play inform formation let's not play

5429
03:30:08,520 --> 03:30:11,199
scared but how do you ensure that not

5430
03:30:11,199 --> 03:30:13,080
playing scared doesn't result in a bad

5431
03:30:13,080 --> 03:30:14,960
initiation Gunner how do you make sure

5432
03:30:14,960 --> 03:30:16,479
or what was their formation to make sure

5433
03:30:16,479 --> 03:30:18,120
every team fight was going to go in that

5434
03:30:18,120 --> 03:30:19,840
way that they could have the advantage

5435
03:30:19,840 --> 03:30:21,199
pretty much what he means is don't make

5436
03:30:21,199 --> 03:30:22,960
the same mistake of the diving too far

5437
03:30:22,960 --> 03:30:24,160
on The High Ground or diving too far in

5438
03:30:24,160 --> 03:30:25,760
that Tri camp in the first game right

5439
03:30:25,760 --> 03:30:27,319
where they just stay in a ball and they

5440
03:30:27,319 --> 03:30:28,920
just move up slowly slowly they take the

5441
03:30:28,920 --> 03:30:30,239
objective that's in front of them they

5442
03:30:30,239 --> 03:30:32,439
don't go for more and every fight seemed

5443
03:30:32,439 --> 03:30:33,920
like Quinn would just delay the fight

5444
03:30:33,920 --> 03:30:35,080
with his ult he would just push back the

5445
03:30:35,080 --> 03:30:36,439
pengo roll or whatever initiation there

5446
03:30:36,439 --> 03:30:39,000
was from Magnus and once the fight kind

5447
03:30:39,000 --> 03:30:41,120
of starts and they get to survive that

5448
03:30:41,120 --> 03:30:42,680
initial time and queen of pain gets two

5449
03:30:42,680 --> 03:30:44,199
Q's off three Q's off the fight just CR

5450
03:30:44,199 --> 03:30:46,720
W is over gaming Gladiators is now a top

5451
03:30:46,720 --> 03:30:47,920
two team they're going to be at the

5452
03:30:47,920 --> 03:30:50,399
Grand finals I'm sure they're related so

5453
03:30:50,399 --> 03:30:52,640
let's hear from them in a little bit

5454
03:30:52,640 --> 03:30:54,040
he's actually not ready yet they want to

5455
03:30:54,040 --> 03:30:55,520
take some time they want to compose

5456
03:30:55,520 --> 03:30:56,640
themselves so we can hear maybe a little

5457
03:30:56,640 --> 03:30:58,920
bit more from you sheep about the game I

5458
03:30:58,920 --> 03:31:00,359
don't know I just thought it was like so

5459
03:31:00,359 --> 03:31:01,720
clean and nice they never really got to

5460
03:31:01,720 --> 03:31:03,880
their timings and when they were able to

5461
03:31:03,880 --> 03:31:05,199
like skew her back it's like you're too

5462
03:31:05,199 --> 03:31:06,520
tanky you're too hard to kill you have

5463
03:31:06,520 --> 03:31:08,399
an AIS like they're playing this so

5464
03:31:08,399 --> 03:31:10,040
carefully and disciplined like the fact

5465
03:31:10,040 --> 03:31:11,600
that they stomped early but the game

5466
03:31:11,600 --> 03:31:13,000
still kind of you know dragged a little

5467
03:31:13,000 --> 03:31:14,560
bit it's just cuz game are not giving

5468
03:31:14,560 --> 03:31:16,960
them any opportunity to throw

5469
03:31:16,960 --> 03:31:18,840
it was a hidden counter pick to the to

5470
03:31:18,840 --> 03:31:20,520
the Pango as well I didn't know that you

5471
03:31:20,520 --> 03:31:21,840
know this queen of pain is such a big

5472
03:31:21,840 --> 03:31:23,399
problem to the Pango unit fights because

5473
03:31:23,399 --> 03:31:24,640
he couldn't really roll into the fight

5474
03:31:24,640 --> 03:31:26,000
and create this Kos because he was

5475
03:31:26,000 --> 03:31:27,800
constantly pushing back and they did a

5476
03:31:27,800 --> 03:31:29,319
really good job of like stopping Magnus

5477
03:31:29,319 --> 03:31:30,880
from initiation because like it was

5478
03:31:30,880 --> 03:31:32,680
their only chance of like getting this

5479
03:31:32,680 --> 03:31:34,439
two or three man RPS to turn the game

5480
03:31:34,439 --> 03:31:35,960
around but they never had a chance to do

5481
03:31:35,960 --> 03:31:37,760
that all right well now I know for sure

5482
03:31:37,760 --> 03:31:39,199
that they are ready we're going to have

5483
03:31:39,199 --> 03:31:40,680
a winners interview we're going to see

5484
03:31:40,680 --> 03:31:42,720
how Ace feels about playing in the grand

5485
03:31:42,720 --> 03:31:44,399
finals being a top two

5486
03:31:44,399 --> 03:31:46,760

Grand finals of the international a

5492
03:32:02,880 --> 03:32:06,040
completely dominant year with only the

5493
03:32:06,040 --> 03:32:08,160
smallest amount of stumbles and now you

5494
03:32:08,160 --> 03:32:10,880
are back and I'd like to see crowd if we

5495

03:33:54,359 --> 03:33:56,560
slack what a fantastic interview we

5535
03:33:56,560 --> 03:33:58,640
finally cracked him we were able to do

5536
03:33:58,640 --> 03:34:01,880
it ASA gave us all his emotion in one go

5537
03:34:01,880 --> 03:34:04,080
that R off the crowd to get them hyped

5538
03:34:04,080 --> 03:34:05,160
for the fact they are going to be going

5539
03:34:05,160 --> 03:34:07,520
to the Grand Final it does mean though

5540
03:34:07,520 --> 03:34:10,160
lgd their run has fallen a little bit

5541
03:34:10,160 --> 03:34:11,840
short they're still third place a top

5542
03:34:11,840 --> 03:34:13,880
three team it's an amazing performance

5543
03:34:13,880 --> 03:34:16,359
considering this org had a pretty big

5544
03:34:16,359 --> 03:34:18,160
roster reshuffle for themselves three

5545
03:34:18,160 --> 03:34:19,920
brand new players this was their first

5546
03:34:19,920 --> 03:34:22,160
TI and they went the distance res not

5547
03:34:22,160 --> 03:34:23,800
the whole way but they went a long way I

5548
03:34:23,800 --> 03:34:25,960
think they did amazingly but the only

5549
03:34:25,960 --> 03:34:28,040
thing I would like uh suggest them for

5550
03:34:28,040 --> 03:34:30,160
the for the future like just like you

5551
03:34:30,160 --> 03:34:32,279
know think about their own play style

5552
03:34:32,279 --> 03:34:34,439
like uh you know find their their

5553
03:34:34,439 --> 03:34:36,520
strategies and like like not respond too

5554
03:34:36,520 --> 03:34:39,040
much to the enemies yeah cuz it always

5555
03:34:39,040 --> 03:34:40,720
seemed like this entire series and kind

5556
03:34:40,720 --> 03:34:42,160
of the entire lower bracket is gaming

5557
03:34:42,160 --> 03:34:44,120
forces everyone to play their game and

5558
03:34:44,120 --> 03:34:46,359
lgd it seemed like they fell to it

5559
03:34:46,359 --> 03:34:47,920
and looking forward there's Spirit which

5560
03:34:47,920 --> 03:34:49,239
I think are one of the teams that are

5561
03:34:49,239 --> 03:34:50,520
really good at doing their own thing

5562
03:34:50,520 --> 03:34:51,479
whether they're winning early game

5563
03:34:51,479 --> 03:34:52,560
losing early game they're going to play

5564
03:34:52,560 --> 03:34:54,800
their game and they're going to win so

5565
03:34:54,800 --> 03:34:56,080
if there's one team that hopefully won't

5566
03:34:56,080 --> 03:34:57,640
conform to how gaming plays it will be

5567
03:34:57,640 --> 03:34:59,600
spirit in the finals how do you feel

5568
03:34:59,600 --> 03:35:01,279
about lgd sheep what's one of your

5569
03:35:01,279 --> 03:35:02,760
highlights that you had over the last

5570
03:35:02,760 --> 03:35:05,319
three weeks with them I just think I

5571
03:35:05,319 --> 03:35:06,439
mean I'm just really happy that they

5572
03:35:06,439 --> 03:35:07,800
managed to take it this far I think like

5573
03:35:07,800 --> 03:35:10,160
them and Azure R really showing up for

5574
03:35:10,160 --> 03:35:12,560
China you know there was this massive

5575
03:35:12,560 --> 03:35:13,840
Gap at the beginning of the year where

5576
03:35:13,840 --> 03:35:16,319
so many old players did retire

5577
03:35:16,319 --> 03:35:18,479
and we had this new players filling in

5578
03:35:18,479 --> 03:35:22,040
like we have how now on lgd and then you

5579
03:35:22,040 --> 03:35:24,319
know some players came back but they

5580
03:35:24,319 --> 03:35:26,520
filled that Gap really well and they got

5581
03:35:26,520 --> 03:35:28,080
the experience they needed to bring

5582
03:35:28,080 --> 03:35:29,960
themselves to This Ti and to perform and

5583
03:35:29,960 --> 03:35:31,760
and so many of these players had their

5584
03:35:31,760 --> 03:35:34,840
first lands this year and like to get

5585
03:35:34,840 --> 03:35:37,000
third place now at TI like that is

5586
03:35:37,000 --> 03:35:38,560
phenomenal like they should be so proud

5587
03:35:38,560 --> 03:35:39,800
of themselves and I really hope they

5588
03:35:39,800 --> 03:35:41,199
take that to next year and go even

5589
03:35:41,199 --> 03:35:43,359
further do you feel like this is the uh

5590
03:35:43,359 --> 03:35:46,279
revitalization of the China region where

5591
03:35:46,279 --> 03:35:47,720
I think for sure they have like a lot of

5592
03:35:47,720 --> 03:35:49,640
motivation right now since two of their

5593
03:35:49,640 --> 03:35:51,359
top teams like in the top three and four

5594
03:35:51,359 --> 03:35:53,680
so it's it's a really big uh boost for

5595
03:35:53,680 --> 03:35:54,920
the region I mean of course it would

5596
03:35:54,920 --> 03:35:56,479
have helped if they won the whole thing

5597
03:35:56,479 --> 03:35:58,199
right but it's still a very good result

5598
03:35:58,199 --> 03:35:59,840
and I'm sure like a lot of people get

5599
03:35:59,840 --> 03:36:01,439
inspired by that and you're going to see

5600
03:36:01,439 --> 03:36:03,000
a lot of more like Chinese competition

5601
03:36:03,000 --> 03:36:05,680
coming into next year and next season

5602
03:36:05,680 --> 03:36:06,880
yeah cuz they struggled I think the full

5603
03:36:06,880 --> 03:36:08,720
season but now it kind of goes to TI and

5604
03:36:08,720 --> 03:36:10,120
this is what matters right so them doing

5605
03:36:10,120 --> 03:36:11,399
good at TI is definitely really good for

5606
03:36:11,399 --> 03:36:13,160
the region yeah they were within the

5607
03:36:13,160 --> 03:36:14,479
region really dominant and then it was

5608
03:36:14,479 --> 03:36:16,800
like that 9th 12th throughout so I think

5609
03:36:16,800 --> 03:36:18,239
it's a massive feat for themselves a

5610
03:36:18,239 --> 03:36:19,760
massive accomplishment so they should be

5611
03:36:19,760 --> 03:36:23,359
very happy but uh lgd falling short here

5612
03:36:23,359 --> 03:36:25,239
but gaming Gladiators moving on do you

5613
03:36:25,239 --> 03:36:26,439
want to talk about the gaming Gladiators

5614
03:36:26,439 --> 03:36:27,840
team spirit match up before we get our

5615
03:36:27,840 --> 03:36:31,680
exit interview yeah sure all right we're

5616
03:36:31,680 --> 03:36:35,000
listening to you so you're the pro um

5617
03:36:35,000 --> 03:36:36,199
again I think it's kind of the same

5618
03:36:36,199 --> 03:36:37,920
story right it's hopefully the the

5619
03:36:37,920 --> 03:36:39,680
drafting you have to solve this early

5620
03:36:39,680 --> 03:36:42,120
game issues where gaming Gladiators wins

5621
03:36:42,120 --> 03:36:43,680
their Lanes Quinn has won his Lane I

5622
03:36:43,680 --> 03:36:45,080
would say probably 80% of the games at

5623
03:36:45,080 --> 03:36:49,040
this t 90% to be nice to him and they

5624
03:36:49,040 --> 03:36:50,199
kind of just snowball off that every

5625
03:36:50,199 --> 03:36:51,640
time and it's also the the supports

5626
03:36:51,640 --> 03:36:53,040
rotating I think the supports are

5627
03:36:53,040 --> 03:36:54,520
probably the best support Duo at

5628
03:36:54,520 --> 03:36:55,880
controlling the early game moving around

5629
03:36:55,880 --> 03:36:58,319
controlling runes ganking mid and just

5630
03:36:58,319 --> 03:36:59,640
the way that they always set up their

5631
03:36:59,640 --> 03:37:01,080
Sidelines as well it's all it's

5632
03:37:01,080 --> 03:37:03,800
everything you just have to counter and

5633
03:37:03,800 --> 03:37:06,160
so to some extent what reso was saying

5634
03:37:06,160 --> 03:37:07,439
was you don't want to purely counter the

5635
03:37:07,439 --> 03:37:08,920
enemy draft but I think there's some

5636
03:37:08,920 --> 03:37:10,800
limit to kind of finding a balance where

5637
03:37:10,800 --> 03:37:12,279
you're doing your own thing that doesn't

5638
03:37:12,279 --> 03:37:13,920
get countered by what gaming is

5639
03:37:13,920 --> 03:37:16,000
doing yeah I'm definitely bit worried

5640
03:37:16,000 --> 03:37:17,920
about Laurel because Quinn is like

5641
03:37:17,920 --> 03:37:19,720
showing like every time like every match

5642
03:37:19,720 --> 03:37:20,800
up like it doesn't matter who he's

5643
03:37:20,800 --> 03:37:22,920
playing against like he's stomping the

5644
03:37:22,920 --> 03:37:24,319
the guy and like also with the support

5645
03:37:24,319 --> 03:37:26,239
rotations like it's a really big problem

5646
03:37:26,239 --> 03:37:28,239
so Spirit needs to be ready for that and

5647
03:37:28,239 --> 03:37:30,160
accounting for that you don't have faith

5648
03:37:30,160 --> 03:37:32,080
in the growth that L has had over this

5649
03:37:32,080 --> 03:37:33,800
year he's been showing up more and more

5650
03:37:33,800 --> 03:37:36,920
every event that we see him I think L is

5651
03:37:36,920 --> 03:37:39,239
like so stable that if you kind of if

5652
03:37:39,239 --> 03:37:40,560
you crush him the way you crush like

5653
03:37:40,560 --> 03:37:42,439
nothing to say in that last game right

5654
03:37:42,439 --> 03:37:43,880
like I think he'll struggle to find a

5655
03:37:43,880 --> 03:37:46,000
game and it will be very hero dependent

5656
03:37:46,000 --> 03:37:47,680
on the impact he's able to have for

5657
03:37:47,680 --> 03:37:49,600
example in games that they're losing

5658
03:37:49,600 --> 03:37:51,399
when he's on cona he's going to play a

5659
03:37:51,399 --> 03:37:52,720
lot better than like when he's on his

5660
03:37:52,720 --> 03:37:55,120
Viper you know just by way of the hero

5661
03:37:55,120 --> 03:37:57,040
by way of his play style so I think it's

5662
03:37:57,040 --> 03:37:58,600
going to come down a lot to the draft I

5663
03:37:58,600 --> 03:37:59,760
really hope he doesn't get his conquer

5664
03:37:59,760 --> 03:38:01,000
game and want to win I hope he does get

5665
03:38:01,000 --> 03:38:04,600
it if you want them to win uh but I I do

5666
03:38:04,600 --> 03:38:06,120
think he's good enough to like play play

5667
03:38:06,120 --> 03:38:07,319
this match easily you know they're in

5668
03:38:07,319 --> 03:38:09,479
the grand finals for a reason waiting

5669
03:38:09,479 --> 03:38:10,840
yeah I mean they did go through Upper

5670
03:38:10,840 --> 03:38:12,000
bracket exactly I was about to say

5671
03:38:12,000 --> 03:38:13,199
they're coming in the upper bracket like

5672
03:38:13,199 --> 03:38:14,520
they were able to stay up there they

5673
03:38:14,520 --> 03:38:16,960
knocked lgd here to be uh then

5674
03:38:16,960 --> 03:38:18,279
eventually knocked out by Gaming

5675
03:38:18,279 --> 03:38:20,920
Gladiators what's a big takeway from the

5676
03:38:20,920 --> 03:38:23,040
lgd team spirit match up that we had in

5677
03:38:23,040 --> 03:38:24,840
the upper bracket yesterday that you're

5678
03:38:24,840 --> 03:38:27,080
like oh maybe this is something that is

5679
03:38:27,080 --> 03:38:28,120
a weakness we haven't seen in team

5680
03:38:28,120 --> 03:38:29,560
spirit before well the biggest thing

5681
03:38:29,560 --> 03:38:30,840
that excites and worries me is that

5682
03:38:30,840 --> 03:38:32,399
there was a 70 minute game which we

5683
03:38:32,399 --> 03:38:34,720
really haven't seen gaming play so

5684
03:38:34,720 --> 03:38:36,040
either spirit will be able to force

5685
03:38:36,040 --> 03:38:37,319
gaming to play this really long game

5686
03:38:37,319 --> 03:38:38,920
which I would say favors them or you

5687
03:38:38,920 --> 03:38:41,000
know will gaming just destroy the

5688
03:38:41,000 --> 03:38:42,319
average game time for Spirit make it

5689
03:38:42,319 --> 03:38:43,640
really low and just kind of Crush three

5690
03:38:43,640 --> 03:38:45,439
games in a row hey that we kind of have

5691
03:38:45,439 --> 03:38:46,800
heard when Ace had his winners interview

5692
03:38:46,800 --> 03:38:47,920
that they're going to keep playing their

5693
03:38:47,920 --> 03:38:49,600
game maybe it's going to be that Tempo

5694
03:38:49,600 --> 03:38:51,120
but right now we do have to close out

5695
03:38:51,120 --> 03:38:53,160
this series we want to hear from one of

5696
03:38:53,160 --> 03:38:55,000
the lgd plays we have an exit interview

5697
03:38:55,000 --> 03:38:57,359
it's tsunami and why you

5698
03:38:57,359 --> 03:38:59,600
smile thank you very much yes I am

5699
03:38:59,600 --> 03:39:01,520
standing by with why you smile and Jin

5700
03:39:01,520 --> 03:39:02,840
will be helping me

5701
03:39:02,840 --> 03:39:05,560
translate um smile it's uh kind of

5702
03:39:05,560 --> 03:39:07,160
strange to think that you're now very

5703
03:39:07,160 --> 03:39:10,560
much a veteran and for a squad like this

5704
03:39:10,560 --> 03:39:13,279
with so many players that are kind of

5705
03:39:13,279 --> 03:39:14,880
new to an experience like this what was

5706
03:39:14,880 --> 03:39:17,080
it like guiding them through such a

5707
03:39:17,080 --> 03:39:19,080
high-intensity tournament here at the

5708
03:39:19,080 --> 03:39:22,080
international

5709
03:39:53,760 --> 03:39:55,720
um it's more of a it feels like a wake

5710
03:39:55,720 --> 03:39:57,640
up call to myself as well because just

5711
03:39:57,640 --> 03:39:59,760
watching these younger players seeing

5712
03:39:59,760 --> 03:40:02,720
that drive seeing the motivation it um

5713
03:40:02,720 --> 03:40:05,160
it kind of it's like a wake up call for

5714
03:40:05,160 --> 03:40:07,680
me it reminds me of what kind of me

5715
03:40:07,680 --> 03:40:10,479
mentality I should be having as well

5716
03:40:10,479 --> 03:40:12,640
that's wonderful to hear then also in

5717
03:40:12,640 --> 03:40:15,560
terms of maybe reigniting your your

5718
03:40:15,560 --> 03:40:17,920
competitive passion obviously here in

5719
03:40:17,920 --> 03:40:20,000
this venue even you must have some very

5720
03:40:20,000 --> 03:40:22,160
fond memories so was there any

5721
03:40:22,160 --> 03:40:24,399
experiences that you had with the fans

5722
03:40:24,399 --> 03:40:27,080
or just the being back in Seattle

5723
03:40:27,080 --> 03:40:29,600
Sensation that you're hoping to remember

5724
03:40:29,600 --> 03:40:32,239
as you leave this

5725
03:40:33,110 --> 03:40:36,149
[Music]

5726
03:40:44,239 --> 03:40:48,000
event for

5727
03:40:48,000 --> 03:40:51,139
[Music]

5728
03:41:08,970 --> 03:41:12,140
[Music]

5729
03:41:22,159 --> 03:41:24,720
um I don't really feel uh much of those

5730
03:41:24,720 --> 03:41:27,159
emotions at this very moment because uh

5731
03:41:27,159 --> 03:41:29,960
we just lot of series feeling pretty sad

5732
03:41:29,960 --> 03:41:32,560
right now however it it is very touching

5733
03:41:32,560 --> 03:41:35,479
to see so many fans so many Chinese fans

5734
03:41:35,479 --> 03:41:37,560
and international fans here at the arena

5735
03:41:37,560 --> 03:41:39,239
cheering for us I think one of the

5736
03:41:39,239 --> 03:41:41,680
biggest sense of loss I feel right now

5737
03:41:41,680 --> 03:41:44,359
is just not being able to get into the

5738
03:41:44,359 --> 03:41:46,279
grand finals not being able to hear them

5739
03:41:46,279 --> 03:41:48,159
cheer for us once

5740
03:41:48,159 --> 03:41:50,560
more well why I'm sure there's no doubt

5741
03:41:50,560 --> 03:41:52,359
in my mind that we will be cheering for

5742
03:41:52,359 --> 03:41:54,800
you no matter what happens in the future

5743
03:41:54,800 --> 03:41:58,720
shisha appreciate it sh and back to the

thank you so much and why Smile as well

5746
03:42:03,600 --> 03:42:06,840
there were a lot of fans every time lgd

5747
03:42:06,840 --> 03:42:09,840
was playing this crowd was louder than I

5748
03:42:09,840 --> 03:42:11,880
felt it could go and it just keeps

5749
03:42:11,880 --> 03:42:14,040
pushing itself more and more so why you

5750
03:42:14,040 --> 03:42:15,720
smile there's a lot of fans here and I'm

5751
03:42:15,720 --> 03:42:17,640
sure that they'll be cheering for you

5752
03:42:17,640 --> 03:42:19,239
maybe even later today if they see you

5753
03:42:19,239 --> 03:42:20,520
around you know they'll be having a lot

5754
03:42:20,520 --> 03:42:22,159
of fun but for now gaming Gladiators

5755
03:42:22,159 --> 03:42:23,840
they got a little bit over an hour reso

5756
03:42:23,840 --> 03:42:25,880
to reset themselves look towards the

5757
03:42:25,880 --> 03:42:28,439
Grand Final you were in a very similar

5758
03:42:28,439 --> 03:42:30,520
position not that long ago what did you

5759
03:42:30,520 --> 03:42:32,359
do with your owl what what do you think

5760
03:42:32,359 --> 03:42:34,439
they doing I mean to me it has been

5761
03:42:34,439 --> 03:42:36,359
really tough because the series that we

5762
03:42:36,359 --> 03:42:38,399
played before was like three three games

5763
03:42:38,399 --> 03:42:40,239
and it was like really like up and go

5764
03:42:40,239 --> 03:42:41,720
like you know you you don't really know

5765
03:42:41,720 --> 03:42:43,399
if you're going to win or not but for

5766
03:42:43,399 --> 03:42:45,239
for game in this time around like there

5767
03:42:45,239 --> 03:42:46,800
very confidently taking those two games

5768
03:42:46,800 --> 03:42:48,359
so they don't really I think they don't

5769
03:42:48,359 --> 03:42:49,800
really wasted allot of their energy so

5770
03:42:49,800 --> 03:42:51,120
they don't really need to do anything

5771
03:42:51,120 --> 03:42:52,880
other than just like you know prepare

5772
03:42:52,880 --> 03:42:54,720
themselves for taking this spirit and

5773
03:42:54,720 --> 03:42:56,720
like think about what kind of Heroes

5774
03:42:56,720 --> 03:42:58,920
they want to draft for the next

5775
03:42:58,920 --> 03:43:00,720
series yeah you don't want to like phase

5776
03:43:00,720 --> 03:43:02,359
yourself too much you still have another

5777
03:43:02,359 --> 03:43:03,840
game you can feel good but at some point

5778
03:43:03,840 --> 03:43:05,640
you have to just reset just all right

5779
03:43:05,640 --> 03:43:07,239
started the new game so let's play the

5780
03:43:07,239 --> 03:43:08,720
new game well look they're going to have

5781
03:43:08,720 --> 03:43:10,600
their time we're going to have some time

5782
03:43:10,600 --> 03:43:13,159
as well and to help us fill in the time

5783
03:43:13,159 --> 03:43:14,800
there's going to be some more content we

5784
03:43:14,800 --> 03:43:17,359
have a very exciting video that we're

5785
03:43:17,359 --> 03:43:20,880
going to get to watch right

5786
03:43:25,479 --> 03:43:30,080
now please this is not how Heroes act

5787
03:43:30,080 --> 03:43:32,040
you both think it's in your nature to

5788
03:43:32,040 --> 03:43:34,800
fight but your first and only answer

5789
03:43:34,800 --> 03:43:38,439
can't always be violence your sisters

5790
03:43:38,439 --> 03:43:40,920
violence is Never My First Choice my

5791
03:43:40,920 --> 03:43:43,560
first choice we know it's why you lose

5792
03:43:43,560 --> 03:43:45,560
Lena I'm just saying sometimes you got

5793
03:43:45,560 --> 03:43:48,159
to burn down if you want to win

5794
03:43:48,159 --> 03:43:49,800
except you don't just burn people or

5795
03:43:49,800 --> 03:43:52,319
things she starts emotional fires she

5796
03:43:52,319 --> 03:43:53,960
knows her stupid real fires can't touch

5797
03:43:53,960 --> 03:43:55,840
me are you kidding me emotional damage

5798
03:43:55,840 --> 03:43:58,000
doesn't even work on you it hurts my

5799
03:43:58,000 --> 03:44:00,439
feelings you don't have feelings seen

5800
03:44:00,439 --> 03:44:02,960
warmer eyes on a shark we should really

5801
03:44:02,960 --> 03:44:04,760
um and nobody's buying your cute little

5802

everything you say is a Lie the nth one

5816
03:44:39,680 --> 03:44:42,479

5817
03:44:42,479 --> 03:44:44,040
last chance and I wasn't going to blow

5818
03:44:44,040 --> 03:44:45,640
it you're right

5819
03:44:45,640 --> 03:44:49,359
I was innocent and no one believed

5820
03:44:49,359 --> 03:44:54,600
me it's funny I was scared at first but

5821
03:44:54,600 --> 03:44:57,120

03:47:03,640 --> 03:47:08,040
that you wait you

5857
03:47:09,680 --> 03:47:12,399

5858
03:47:12,399 --> 03:47:16,720
you okay maybe I don't respect it

5859
03:47:16,720 --> 03:47:18,199

5860
03:47:18,199 --> 03:47:22,040
proud you solved a problem with

5861
03:47:22,040 --> 03:47:23,960
fire and

5862
03:47:23,960 --> 03:47:26,520
lies that's my

5863
03:47:26,520 --> 03:47:29,960
playbook you learn that from

5864
03:47:29,960 --> 03:47:33,040
me I didn't think you were that smart

5865
03:47:33,040 --> 03:47:35,439
that's not the lesson here you need to

5866
03:47:35,439 --> 03:47:37,880
work on your problems you can't just

5867
03:47:37,880 --> 03:47:41,159
commit arson that's

5868
03:47:41,159 --> 03:47:44,600

5874

6216
04:08:32,680 --> 04:08:34,960
image right now all right we know we all

6217
04:08:34,960 --> 04:08:37,239
had troubled past do you not believe in

6218
04:08:37,239 --> 04:08:40,399
second chances uh it's been a while and

6219
04:08:40,399 --> 04:08:42,479
his Persona has been the same so I don't

6220
04:08:42,479 --> 04:08:44,119
know if he's going to recover from the

6221
04:08:44,119 --> 04:08:45,960
mentality or not

6222
04:08:45,960 --> 04:08:48,640
but what's on your mind friend Quinn

6223
04:08:48,640 --> 04:08:50,960
will

6224
04:08:51,880 --> 04:08:55,279
win yay you think being a TI winner will

6225
04:08:55,279 --> 04:08:56,720
change someone's personality for the

6226
04:08:56,720 --> 04:08:58,080
better or for the

6227
04:08:58,080 --> 04:09:01,600
worse um

6228
04:09:01,600 --> 04:09:04,159
better I mean you can talk to S4 after

6229
04:09:04,159 --> 04:09:05,680
that it doesn't get much better than

6230
04:09:05,680 --> 04:09:09,080

04:10:09,920 --> 04:10:11,319
about to have their grand final and

6254
04:10:11,319 --> 04:10:14,760
hopefully win a TI whichever team it is

6255
04:10:14,760 --> 04:10:16,560
I want to start all the way down the end

6256
04:10:16,560 --> 04:10:18,560
with dendi you were the beginning of

6257
04:10:18,560 --> 04:10:20,880
this you won your ti so many years ago

6258
04:10:20,880 --> 04:10:24,600
did you expect ti2 to happen to be in

6259
04:10:24,600 --> 04:10:26,680
Seattle to have a crowd like this and

6260
04:10:26,680 --> 04:10:28,159
the history and the Legacy that it would

6261
04:10:28,159 --> 04:10:31,080
create oh of course not like it's hard

6262
04:10:31,080 --> 04:10:33,399
to expect something like this but yeah

6263
04:10:33,399 --> 04:10:36,840
back in my days it was a long time ago

6264
04:10:36,840 --> 04:10:39,720
and different stories were around

6265
04:10:39,720 --> 04:10:42,560
overall I love it like STI is great uh

6266
04:10:42,560 --> 04:10:44,359
competition is super high level watching

6267
04:10:44,359 --> 04:10:47,439
those teams is amazing good feelings do

6268
04:10:47,439 --> 04:10:48,600
you think you'd have nerves if you were

6269
04:10:48,600 --> 04:10:50,199
going into this Grand Final either as

6270
04:10:50,199 --> 04:10:51,880
gaming Gladiators or team spirit with

6271
04:10:51,880 --> 04:10:54,840
the crowd no nerves at all come on look

6272
04:10:54,840 --> 04:10:57,560
at this what kind of nerves can it be no

6273
04:10:57,560 --> 04:11:00,640
way everyone is cheerful so it's easy

6274
04:11:00,640 --> 04:11:03,640
peasy for sure JX we'll move up here

6275
04:11:03,640 --> 04:11:07,359
because two-time TI winner Teen Spirit

6276
04:11:07,359 --> 04:11:08,800
going into the grand finals they could

6277
04:11:08,800 --> 04:11:10,279
be joining you in the ranks of a

6278
04:11:10,279 --> 04:11:13,760
two-time TI winner does you like I don't

6279
04:11:13,760 --> 04:11:15,159
want to share that title with anyone or

6280
04:11:15,159 --> 04:11:16,720
are you hoping that another team is able

6281
04:11:16,720 --> 04:11:18,920
to do it too I think there's some

6282
04:11:18,920 --> 04:11:20,960
anxiety about it but uh in the end of

6283
04:11:20,960 --> 04:11:22,920
the day I feel like we're all cheering

6284
04:11:22,920 --> 04:11:25,239
for the best DOTA and uh if that happens

6285
04:11:25,239 --> 04:11:28,439
here then doesn't really matter it

6286
04:11:28,439 --> 04:11:29,720
doesn't matter at the end of the day

6287
04:11:29,720 --> 04:11:31,840
were you more nervous the second time

6288
04:11:31,840 --> 04:11:33,800
round when heading into the grand finals

6289
04:11:33,800 --> 04:11:35,840
you're like no one else has done this no

6290
04:11:35,840 --> 04:11:38,239
one's won two or was it more we've been

6291
04:11:38,239 --> 04:11:40,119
here before and we've done it we can win

6292
04:11:40,119 --> 04:11:43,399
a grand finals uh I think the emotion

6293
04:11:43,399 --> 04:11:45,359
that I had the most is I think we kind

6294
04:11:45,359 --> 04:11:47,199
of ran out of the game so that was

6295
04:11:47,199 --> 04:11:49,119
frustrating I would say because the

6296
04:11:49,119 --> 04:11:51,040
first time we just went through the open

6297
04:11:51,040 --> 04:11:53,920
qualifiers all the way and uh I think as

6298
04:11:53,920 --> 04:11:55,600
a player you really cherish these

6299
04:11:55,600 --> 04:11:56,920
moments when you really get to play on

6300
04:11:56,920 --> 04:11:59,479
the highest competitive uh environment

6301
04:11:59,479 --> 04:12:02,960
and uh yeah maybe frustrated oh that's

6302
04:12:02,960 --> 04:12:04,920
an interesting emotion to feel but how

6303
04:12:04,920 --> 04:12:06,920
you've been uh in two grand finals as

6304
04:12:06,920 --> 04:12:10,040
well one as a coach one as a player is

6305
04:12:10,040 --> 04:12:12,159
it hard being a coach seeing the grand

6306
04:12:12,159 --> 04:12:14,000
finals like what would silent and see

6307
04:12:14,000 --> 04:12:15,800
why be feeling out there seeing their

6308
04:12:15,800 --> 04:12:18,199
five players about to walk on I think as

6309
04:12:18,199 --> 04:12:19,960
a coach at this point you're mostly just

6310
04:12:19,960 --> 04:12:21,359
proud of what your players have done

6311
04:12:21,359 --> 04:12:22,479
what they've come through you've watched

6312
04:12:22,479 --> 04:12:24,520
them work hard for so long I think

6313
04:12:24,520 --> 04:12:26,000
mostly what you want is for them to be

6314
04:12:26,000 --> 04:12:28,000
able to enjoy the moment the best do is

6315
04:12:28,000 --> 04:12:29,279
played when you're having

6316
04:12:29,279 --> 04:12:33,319
fun and FIA you shared your win with OE

6317
04:12:33,319 --> 04:12:35,119
do you want to any any stories any

6318
04:12:35,119 --> 04:12:36,720
feelings that you had cuz you're a very

6319
04:12:36,720 --> 04:12:41,279
stoic man I think any I think any like

6320
04:12:41,279 --> 04:12:42,720
uh finals experience is going to be

6321
04:12:42,720 --> 04:12:44,720
different for everyone right but the

6322
04:12:44,720 --> 04:12:46,640
when I went into it most I was thinking

6323
04:12:46,640 --> 04:12:47,840
there's always going to be nerves of

6324
04:12:47,840 --> 04:12:49,560
course but what I always told myself

6325
04:12:49,560 --> 04:12:52,279
going into it is just like as long as I

6326
04:12:52,279 --> 04:12:54,279
choke less than the other team or I'm

6327
04:12:54,279 --> 04:12:57,000
less nervous than the other team that's

6328
04:12:57,000 --> 04:12:58,479
good enough you know what I mean cuz

6329
04:12:58,479 --> 04:12:59,800
every single time you're going to be a

6330
04:12:59,800 --> 04:13:02,040
little bit nervous what was the main

6331
04:13:02,040 --> 04:13:03,399
feeling then jerx you were saying

6332
04:13:03,399 --> 04:13:04,720
frustrated was that the second time

6333
04:13:04,720 --> 04:13:06,040
round or the first time you were saying

6334
04:13:06,040 --> 04:13:08,080
was uh that was the second time so just

6335
04:13:08,080 --> 04:13:09,920
the lack of games I feel like when it

6336
04:13:09,920 --> 04:13:12,319
goes really fast then you don't really

6337
04:13:12,319 --> 04:13:14,600
get to prove yourself as to the same

6338
04:13:14,600 --> 04:13:16,399
level I don't know I think that's fair

6339
04:13:16,399 --> 04:13:18,119
that's a very valid thing to be able to

6340
04:13:18,119 --> 04:13:20,239
say yeah of course I'm not that's that's

6341
04:13:20,239 --> 04:13:22,119
how I felt so the first win meant just a

6342
04:13:22,119 --> 04:13:23,439
little bit more even though both yeah

6343
04:13:23,439 --> 04:13:25,760
absolutely yeah interesting what was

6344
04:13:25,760 --> 04:13:27,560
your main feeling

6345
04:13:27,560 --> 04:13:31,000
OE for for TI 11 either one you can tell

6346
04:13:31,000 --> 04:13:33,359
me I mean I think ti5 is definitely more

6347
04:13:33,359 --> 04:13:35,239
nervous like as a player than a coach I

6348
04:13:35,239 --> 04:13:37,840
think um it's just so much happening you

6349
04:13:37,840 --> 04:13:39,479
feel the vibration of the crowd you

6350
04:13:39,479 --> 04:13:40,600
don't really know what's going on I

6351
04:13:40,600 --> 04:13:41,800
hadn't really experienced anything like

6352
04:13:41,800 --> 04:13:43,880
that before for TI 11 was a lot more

6353
04:13:43,880 --> 04:13:45,920
calm we worked a lot on like controlling

6354
04:13:45,920 --> 04:13:47,319
our emotions to make sure that we were

6355
04:13:47,319 --> 04:13:49,720
in the best performance shape I think it

6356
04:13:49,720 --> 04:13:51,920
honestly sort of similar to JX like we

6357
04:13:51,920 --> 04:13:55,040
wanted to show off our DOTA and I mean

6358
04:13:55,040 --> 04:13:57,560
TI 11 maybe similar to ti9 not the best

6359
04:13:57,560 --> 04:14:01,159
for that yeah may I don't know I can't

6360
04:14:01,159 --> 04:14:02,800
really speak for you but uh for my

6361
04:14:02,800 --> 04:14:05,600
that's my only experience yeah mhm what

6362
04:14:05,600 --> 04:14:07,520
advice would you give to those 10

6363
04:14:07,520 --> 04:14:09,000
players out there right now what is

6364
04:14:09,000 --> 04:14:11,040
something that you wish you had have

6365
04:14:11,040 --> 04:14:12,840
heard when you were in the tunnels when

6366
04:14:12,840 --> 04:14:14,960
you were building up to walk out when

6367
04:14:14,960 --> 04:14:16,840
you know you either had the the lower

6368
04:14:16,840 --> 04:14:18,439
bracket 1 hour wait or when you were

6369
04:14:18,439 --> 04:14:19,960
coming in from the upper bracket if you

6370
04:14:19,960 --> 04:14:22,359
want to start dendy sure uh simple

6371
04:14:22,359 --> 04:14:25,479
advice play the best daughter of your

6372
04:14:25,479 --> 04:14:27,800
life I think this a sort of advice the

6373
04:14:27,800 --> 04:14:29,439
crowd would give as well I mean it's

6374
04:14:29,439 --> 04:14:30,760
going to be similar for me like you just

6375
04:14:30,760 --> 04:14:32,920
don't get this opportunity very often

6376
04:14:32,920 --> 04:14:34,279
who knows the next time you'll be in

6377
04:14:34,279 --> 04:14:36,199
this position this is like going to be

6378
04:14:36,199 --> 04:14:38,520
your opportunity to potentially win a TI

6379
04:14:38,520 --> 04:14:40,119
in spirit's case win another TI against

6380
04:14:40,119 --> 04:14:42,359
Laurel's first cherish it and take

6381
04:14:42,359 --> 04:14:43,800
advantage of this moment and do the best

6382
04:14:43,800 --> 04:14:45,520
you possibly can

6383
04:14:45,520 --> 04:14:48,760
mhm yeah no same for me I think just

6384
04:14:48,760 --> 04:14:50,560
make sure that like the main thing you

6385
04:14:50,560 --> 04:14:52,080
have here is making these memories I

6386
04:14:52,080 --> 04:14:53,720
think that's the most important thing no

6387
04:14:53,720 --> 04:14:55,399
matter what happens win or lose you want

6388
04:14:55,399 --> 04:14:56,800
to be proud of what you've accomplished

6389
04:14:56,800 --> 04:14:57,960
in

6390
04:14:57,960 --> 04:15:02,159
Dota uh personally for me I feel there's

6391
04:15:02,159 --> 04:15:03,920
a when the nerves really get to you you

6392
04:15:03,920 --> 04:15:05,800
start to really look outside but I think

6393
04:15:05,800 --> 04:15:07,880
if you really tune into yourself and

6394
04:15:07,880 --> 04:15:09,640
give opportunities to those thoughts of

6395
04:15:09,640 --> 04:15:11,520
like okay we have this crazy idea we

6396
04:15:11,520 --> 04:15:12,640
don't really feel like pulling it here

6397
04:15:12,640 --> 04:15:14,439
in the finals but I I think if you

6398
04:15:14,439 --> 04:15:16,640
commit to that I think that goes very

6399
04:15:16,640 --> 04:15:18,760
well mhm how much internal pressure did

6400
04:15:18,760 --> 04:15:21,040
you guys place on yourself and who was

6401
04:15:21,040 --> 04:15:23,040
trying to help you pull that out of you

6402
04:15:23,040 --> 04:15:24,279
that you weren't getting too caught up

6403
04:15:24,279 --> 04:15:27,080
in your head is that for me yeah all of

6404
04:15:27,080 --> 04:15:30,359
you guys um Johan was the very big part

6405
04:15:30,359 --> 04:15:34,760
of our energy mhm our flower uh uh I

6406
04:15:34,760 --> 04:15:37,239
definitely felt that uh I was very

6407
04:15:37,239 --> 04:15:40,000
supported in the team uh and if if that

6408
04:15:40,000 --> 04:15:41,359
wasn't the case I don't think I would

6409
04:15:41,359 --> 04:15:43,720
have enjoyed as much

6410
04:15:43,720 --> 04:15:45,960
I think honestly during T 5 It Was Fear

6411
04:15:45,960 --> 04:15:47,439
like he was always a solid rock you

6412
04:15:47,439 --> 04:15:49,279
could I feel like fear actually has a

6413
04:15:49,279 --> 04:15:50,680
DOTA superpower like he makes all his

6414
04:15:50,680 --> 04:15:51,920
teammates feel super comfortable and

6415
04:15:51,920 --> 04:15:53,319
able to play at their best cuz he's so

6416
04:15:53,319 --> 04:15:56,119
reliable and at TI 11 it was supposed to

6417
04:15:56,119 --> 04:15:59,399
be me I think but just I don't know just

6418
04:15:59,399 --> 04:16:00,399
a little bit of all of you it was more

6419
04:16:00,399 --> 04:16:02,239
chill you know yeah I mean I say that

6420
04:16:02,239 --> 04:16:04,199
about fear for for panels as well he

6421
04:16:04,199 --> 04:16:05,439
definitely calms the nerves for all of

6422
04:16:05,439 --> 04:16:07,279
us well I guess for me then I kind of

6423
04:16:07,279 --> 04:16:09,199
felt like on E there it was an unspoken

6424
04:16:09,199 --> 04:16:11,960
rule that everyone kind of just had to

6425
04:16:11,960 --> 04:16:13,680
play their part you know and just be

6426
04:16:13,680 --> 04:16:15,720
confident in what we're doing and just

6427
04:16:15,720 --> 04:16:17,199
believe and I didn't really feel like

6428
04:16:17,199 --> 04:16:19,000
anyone looked up to anyone personally

6429
04:16:19,000 --> 04:16:21,560
speaking and I thought we just like were

6430
04:16:21,560 --> 04:16:23,239
just going at it together and we all

6431
04:16:23,239 --> 04:16:24,479
knew what we needed to do and just had

6432
04:16:24,479 --> 04:16:28,600
to get it done uh I had an amazing team

6433
04:16:28,600 --> 04:16:30,960
and I was very unconfident coming to the

6434
04:16:30,960 --> 04:16:33,159
ti actually but they all cheered me up

6435
04:16:33,159 --> 04:16:34,600
through the entire tournament and coming

6436
04:16:34,600 --> 04:16:37,040
to the Grand finals I had the feeling we

6437
04:16:37,040 --> 04:16:38,960
cannot lose that's the feeling I got

6438
04:16:38,960 --> 04:16:40,760
it's very weird I don't know if I would

6439
04:16:40,760 --> 04:16:43,800
ever repeat okay when was the shift for

6440
04:16:43,800 --> 04:16:45,319
each of you then that you felt you

6441
04:16:45,319 --> 04:16:47,279
cannot lose this at what point in the

6442
04:16:47,279 --> 04:16:49,640
tournament if you were coming in nervous

6443
04:16:49,640 --> 04:16:51,600
what point was that changing for me it's

6444
04:16:51,600 --> 04:16:53,640
if Curtis ever got techies or

6445
04:16:53,640 --> 04:16:55,880
nagu I just knew we couldn't lose you

6446
04:16:55,880 --> 04:16:57,960
know he was a guaranteed win so yours is

6447
04:16:57,960 --> 04:17:00,399
in the draft all right I see I see I

6448
04:17:00,399 --> 04:17:02,560
mean we we were so confident that uh we

6449
04:17:02,560 --> 04:17:04,640
even pick like in one of the games we

6450
04:17:04,640 --> 04:17:06,439
picked P just because we wanted to have

6451
04:17:06,439 --> 04:17:08,960
some fun you know like to play it yeah

6452
04:17:08,960 --> 04:17:11,840
so it was kind of crazy back in the days

6453
04:17:11,840 --> 04:17:13,479
yeah honestly I think as soon as like

6454
04:17:13,479 --> 04:17:14,880
Bobba found out they don't play lash

6455
04:17:14,880 --> 04:17:17,080
rack that too yeah yeah and S was like

6456
04:17:17,080 --> 04:17:21,399
okay free win that was that was good uh

6457
04:17:21,399 --> 04:17:23,239
I didn't really think if we going to win

6458
04:17:23,239 --> 04:17:25,359
or lose I really just played I don't

6459
04:17:25,359 --> 04:17:27,960
know I I just had a lot of fun myself uh

6460
04:17:27,960 --> 04:17:29,439
I didn't really get to think that if

6461
04:17:29,439 --> 04:17:32,520
we're going to win or lose I didn't yeah

6462
04:17:32,520 --> 04:17:33,880
do you guys want to show off your rings

6463
04:17:33,880 --> 04:17:35,239
by the way I don't know if everyone in

6464
04:17:35,239 --> 04:17:37,640
the audience has seen these before but I

6465
04:17:37,640 --> 04:17:39,279
mean you got two J so we'll start with

6467
04:17:41,159 --> 04:17:43,080

6468
04:17:43,080 --> 04:17:44,960
when you picked it up as well because

6469
04:17:44,960 --> 04:17:46,359
there's going to be five players and a

6470
04:17:46,359 --> 04:17:48,279
coach getting to pick up theirs in uh

6471
04:17:48,279 --> 04:17:50,119
you know after this one I think they're

6472
04:17:50,119 --> 04:17:52,640
getting Dusty most of the

6473
04:17:52,640 --> 04:17:55,680
time and uh I I I guess I don't really

6474
04:17:55,680 --> 04:17:59,319
have a place to show them except this

6475
04:17:59,319 --> 04:18:01,439

04:18:15,080 --> 04:18:17,199
around the arena uh no I don't leave

6484
04:18:17,199 --> 04:18:18,920
home without it yeah I thought so yeah

6485
04:18:18,920 --> 04:18:20,159
I've seen you all the time Fe he's

6486
04:18:20,159 --> 04:18:21,359
polishing it in the back room in the

6487
04:18:21,359 --> 04:18:22,800
Green Room he's just making sure that

6488
04:18:22,800 --> 04:18:25,159
that is shiny as we got slack in the

6489
04:18:25,159 --> 04:18:26,680
crowd we wanted to ask some more

6490
04:18:26,680 --> 04:18:28,319
questions out there there's going to be

6491
04:18:28,319 --> 04:18:30,479
some fan questions hey slack give give

6492
04:18:30,479 --> 04:18:32,840
us the first one yes yes I've spent a

6493
04:18:32,840 --> 04:18:34,520
lot of time finding someone with a real

6494
04:18:34,520 --> 04:18:36,520
question that was not trolling thank you

6495
04:18:36,520 --> 04:18:39,239
one person in this entire area but we

6496
04:18:39,239 --> 04:18:41,520
did get a what was your name sahim all

6497
04:18:41,520 --> 04:18:42,960
right fantastic what would you like to

6498
04:18:42,960 --> 04:18:47,800
ask these folks for all our Aron Heralds

6499
04:18:47,800 --> 04:18:51,119
and Crusaders out here uh what does it

6500
04:18:51,119 --> 04:18:53,960
take to be a TI Champion what does it

6501
04:18:53,960 --> 04:18:57,199
take TI Champions to be a TI Champion

6502
04:18:57,199 --> 04:18:59,399
besides just being one of these Aron

6503
04:18:59,399 --> 04:19:02,800
haral Crusader scrubs no offense to 90%

6504
04:19:02,800 --> 04:19:04,600
of the audience do you want to go first

6505
04:19:04,600 --> 04:19:06,920
JX because you've had to do it twice in

6506
04:19:06,920 --> 04:19:08,479
two very different ways a lot of

6507
04:19:08,479 --> 04:19:09,760
emotional damage in your public

6508
04:19:09,760 --> 04:19:12,760
matchmaking

6509
04:19:13,199 --> 04:19:15,479
but that's the solid advice to be a TI

6510
04:19:15,479 --> 04:19:17,040
Champion all right all right I don't

6511
04:19:17,040 --> 04:19:18,800
think you can make the step from being

6512
04:19:18,800 --> 04:19:21,199
archon Herald to TI Champion that can be

6513
04:19:21,199 --> 04:19:23,040
your dream your aspirations but I think

6514
04:19:23,040 --> 04:19:25,000
the only advice I can give is just play

6515
04:19:25,000 --> 04:19:27,239
a lot of DOTA just keep playing and

6516
04:19:27,239 --> 04:19:28,239
eventually you'll play with better

6517
04:19:28,239 --> 04:19:30,159
players and then you'll play with pros

6518
04:19:30,159 --> 04:19:31,800
and then from there you'll get on teams

6519
04:19:31,800 --> 04:19:33,640
and then it's a slow process but it will

6520
04:19:33,640 --> 04:19:35,479
happen yeah I you were saying the other

6521
04:19:35,479 --> 04:19:37,359
day that it's a it's a lot of luck a lot

6522
04:19:37,359 --> 04:19:39,040
of things kind of falling into place for

6523
04:19:39,040 --> 04:19:41,199
you yeah I think it's a lot of luck

6524
04:19:41,199 --> 04:19:42,520
honestly but I think it's you have to

6525
04:19:42,520 --> 04:19:43,920
like put yourself in a position to get

6526
04:19:43,920 --> 04:19:46,080
lucky think if as Fe said like if you

6527
04:19:46,080 --> 04:19:47,600
just keep grinding at it like that's

6528
04:19:47,600 --> 04:19:49,800
going to open the opportunities for you

6529
04:19:49,800 --> 04:19:51,080
do you want to add anything else to oh

6530
04:19:51,080 --> 04:19:52,800
yeah I completely agree with to that you

6531
04:19:52,800 --> 04:19:55,760
need to love the game and uh try to not

6532
04:19:55,760 --> 04:19:57,640
get frustrated in your Pub games which

6533
04:19:57,640 --> 04:20:00,119
is not as simple wish somebody told me

6534
04:20:00,119 --> 04:20:02,720
that before yeah then maybe not so much

6535
04:20:02,720 --> 04:20:04,119
emotional damage would have occurred

6536
04:20:04,119 --> 04:20:06,399
before JX here tsunami is also out there

6537
04:20:06,399 --> 04:20:08,680
he is another fan with another

6538
04:20:08,680 --> 04:20:10,960
question that's right uh my friend

6539
04:20:10,960 --> 04:20:14,080
introduce yourself uh my name is Seth

6540
04:20:14,080 --> 04:20:15,920
and you got a question for one of our

6541
04:20:15,920 --> 04:20:19,319
panelists of course for fear so my

6542
04:20:19,319 --> 04:20:21,520
friends got inspired to play Dota 2

6543
04:20:21,520 --> 04:20:22,760
because the North American

6544
04:20:22,760 --> 04:20:25,680
representation so how does it feel fear

6545
04:20:25,680 --> 04:20:28,600
to be the North American representative

6546
04:20:28,600 --> 04:20:31,080
of Dota 2 free to play I mean you were

6547
04:20:31,080 --> 04:20:34,399

6548
04:20:34,399 --> 04:20:35,800
just feel honored to give him the

6549
04:20:35,800 --> 04:20:38,040
opportunity to like be represented in

6550
04:20:38,040 --> 04:20:39,600
free to play like they could have chose

6551
04:20:39,600 --> 04:20:41,359
a lot of different people they chose me

6552
04:20:41,359 --> 04:20:43,800
I just love DOTA overall and I'm just

6553
04:20:43,800 --> 04:20:45,840
very fortunate I feel blessed that I was

6554
04:20:45,840 --> 04:20:48,080
just given this opportunity and I just

6555
04:20:48,080 --> 04:20:49,840
will run with it for as long as I can

6556
04:20:49,840 --> 04:20:51,560
cuz I just love DOTA so I'm just happy

6557
04:20:51,560 --> 04:20:53,840
to be

6558
04:20:54,199 --> 04:20:56,159
here think we're going to giving you a

6559
04:20:56,159 --> 04:20:58,239
big round of applause that that's also

6560
04:20:58,239 --> 04:21:00,199
made me think about another question is

6561
04:21:00,199 --> 04:21:03,080
at the end of uh the grand finals I'm

6562
04:21:03,080 --> 04:21:04,920
sure you guys had a lot of elation a lot

6563
04:21:04,920 --> 04:21:07,359
of Joy maybe even relief but when did it

6564
04:21:07,359 --> 04:21:09,680
really set in where were you like oh I

6565
04:21:09,680 --> 04:21:11,080
wish I had to spent more time in the

6566
04:21:11,080 --> 04:21:13,439
moment was it a couple months after or

6567
04:21:13,439 --> 04:21:14,960
it still really hasn't every time you

6568
04:21:14,960 --> 04:21:16,960
come back to TI you're you're taking it

6569
04:21:16,960 --> 04:21:18,920
back to what has happened in your your

6570
04:21:18,920 --> 04:21:22,040
past in your history uh I think uh

6571
04:21:22,040 --> 04:21:24,520
thinking years back I feel like now it's

6572
04:21:24,520 --> 04:21:27,239
maybe coming more than before uh

6573
04:21:27,239 --> 04:21:28,960
personally after the especially the

6574
04:21:28,960 --> 04:21:30,720
first TI I think it took me like two

6575
04:21:30,720 --> 04:21:32,399
weeks to even understand what happened

6576
04:21:32,399 --> 04:21:34,319
mhm uh because I was so much in the

6577
04:21:34,319 --> 04:21:36,239
moment and I guess that kind of carried

6578
04:21:36,239 --> 04:21:38,040
over that you're just not really

6579
04:21:38,040 --> 04:21:40,000
thinking what had

6580
04:21:40,000 --> 04:21:42,159
happened yeah honestly I think the same

6581
04:21:42,159 --> 04:21:45,159
like when you're there like there's just

6582
04:21:45,159 --> 04:21:46,800
lights everywhere there's fireworks

6583
04:21:46,800 --> 04:21:48,439
you're just like the confetti coming

6584
04:21:48,439 --> 04:21:50,640
down you're like oh I guess we lifted

6585
04:21:50,640 --> 04:21:52,040
this now but I think as soon as you have

6586
04:21:52,040 --> 04:21:53,359
some time and you think about like these

6587
04:21:53,359 --> 04:21:54,680
are the memories you'll never forget

6588
04:21:54,680 --> 04:21:56,600
like you always remember these moments

6589
04:21:56,600 --> 04:21:58,279
oh that's so sweet yeah it took a very

6590
04:21:58,279 --> 04:22:00,359
long time for me as well like there's a

6591
04:22:00,359 --> 04:22:02,319
lot of people cheering for you you get

6592
04:22:02,319 --> 04:22:04,080
you win there's confetti you talk about

6593
04:22:04,080 --> 04:22:05,840
you get back home and I'm like all I've

6594
04:22:05,840 --> 04:22:07,960
been doing is playing DOTA for years and

6595
04:22:07,960 --> 04:22:09,159
years so what did I do when I got back

6596
04:22:09,159 --> 04:22:10,760
home I just queued it up and just played

6597
04:22:10,760 --> 04:22:13,359
more DOTA so it just felt like nothing

6598
04:22:13,359 --> 04:22:15,600
happened I was just back on it and later

6599
04:22:15,600 --> 04:22:17,960
onal damage once you start playing less

6600
04:22:17,960 --> 04:22:19,479
DOTA you're not playing as competitive

6601
04:22:19,479 --> 04:22:21,359
anymore then you really look back and

6602
04:22:21,359 --> 04:22:24,399
how special these moments really are um

6603
04:22:24,399 --> 04:22:28,279
I had a year for like a week I think and

6604
04:22:28,279 --> 04:22:30,399
I was looking in the sky and like oh my

6605
04:22:30,399 --> 04:22:33,279
God so good like that happened a lot of

6606
04:22:33,279 --> 04:22:36,479
times through that week and trying to uh

6607
04:22:36,479 --> 04:22:38,279
work through the information in my head

6608
04:22:38,279 --> 04:22:41,840
we actually won TI wow and yeah after a

6609
04:22:41,840 --> 04:22:44,279
week get back to normal and just keep

6610
04:22:44,279 --> 04:22:47,279
green going such a surreal feeling that

6611
04:22:47,279 --> 04:22:49,119
sometimes it's like uh it never really

6612
04:22:49,119 --> 04:22:50,479
will set in but we're going to keep

6613
04:22:50,479 --> 04:22:52,239
asking some more questions we got slack

6614
04:22:52,239 --> 04:22:54,479
out there another fan another question

6615
04:22:54,479 --> 04:22:56,560
let's hear what it

6616
04:22:56,560 --> 04:22:59,600
is thank you thank you now I did have a

6617
04:22:59,600 --> 04:23:01,239
question by the way I I managed to catch

6618
04:23:01,239 --> 04:23:04,159
up with a guy who has a or sign earlier

6619
04:23:04,159 --> 04:23:06,319
and I said what the hell is that and he

6620
04:23:06,319 --> 04:23:09,520
said quote I don't know I just think

6621
04:23:09,520 --> 04:23:11,119
it's

6622
04:23:11,119 --> 04:23:16,199
funny so thanks a lot all day this guy

6623
04:23:17,560 --> 04:23:20,680
about that's a goddamn mad man anyway uh

6624
04:23:20,680 --> 04:23:23,319
a real question what is your name Dylan

6625
04:23:23,319 --> 04:23:25,399
Dylan what do you have for these Legends

6626
04:23:25,399 --> 04:23:29,840
of Dota 2 Legends of Dota 2 what advice

6627
04:23:29,840 --> 04:23:32,040
would you give to the teams that have

6628
04:23:32,040 --> 04:23:37,199
been vanquished from ti do you disband

6629
04:23:37,199 --> 04:23:40,920
do you reform how do you how do you move

6630
04:23:40,920 --> 04:23:43,040
forward as an org yeah good luck with

6631
04:23:43,040 --> 04:23:45,399
this one owie

6632
04:23:45,399 --> 04:23:47,920
me yeah I mean I guess it's it's a tough

6633
04:23:47,920 --> 04:23:49,359
question even when you do win TI what

6634
04:23:49,359 --> 04:23:52,540
you do with uh the roster after that

6635
04:23:52,540 --> 04:23:54,800
[Laughter]

6636
04:23:54,800 --> 04:23:57,720
one I don't know I think honestly if you

6637
04:23:57,720 --> 04:23:59,800
attend a TI you wash a final you was and

6638
04:23:59,800 --> 04:24:02,159
win and it doesn't motivate you then

6639
04:24:02,159 --> 04:24:03,520
maybe you take a break but for I think

6640
04:24:03,520 --> 04:24:05,520
for like 99% of DOTA players they wash

6641
04:24:05,520 --> 04:24:07,040
it and like this is the fire that burns

6642
04:24:07,040 --> 04:24:08,159
this is what keeps you going through the

6643
04:24:08,159 --> 04:24:11,359
emotional damage and Trauma so yeah just

6644
04:24:11,359 --> 04:24:13,560
keep going it's being a spectator at an

6645
04:24:13,560 --> 04:24:15,800
event that you were a part of you wanted

6646
04:24:15,800 --> 04:24:17,600
to win you had that drive motivation and

6647
04:24:17,600 --> 04:24:18,920
passion but you just couldn't get there

6648
04:24:18,920 --> 04:24:21,279
in the end then you're not in your head

6649
04:24:21,279 --> 04:24:23,680
yeah it's very tough sometimes but it's

6650
04:24:23,680 --> 04:24:25,960
good to live in a moment and enjoy

6651
04:24:25,960 --> 04:24:28,080
because uh this is also great experience

6652
04:24:28,080 --> 04:24:30,119
to watch it from crowd and have a lot of

6653
04:24:30,119 --> 04:24:34,640
fun for sure do you want to add F JX

6654
04:24:34,640 --> 04:24:36,040
advice for teams that have gotten

6655
04:24:36,040 --> 04:24:38,080
knocked out yeah you're pretty normally

6656
04:24:38,080 --> 04:24:40,199
brutally honest sure I mean for a lot of

6657
04:24:40,199 --> 04:24:41,560
the teams that have got knocked out

6658
04:24:41,560 --> 04:24:42,720
they're they're still young like I

6659
04:24:42,720 --> 04:24:45,119
didn't even win until I was 27 so just

6660
04:24:45,119 --> 04:24:47,319
keep at it keep grinding like it's good

6661
04:24:47,319 --> 04:24:48,800
to feel sad in my opinion it's good to

6662
04:24:48,800 --> 04:24:51,119
feel that's motivation right so as long

6663
04:24:51,119 --> 04:24:52,359
as you don't give up and you still have

6664
04:24:52,359 --> 04:24:54,399
the passion as long as you think you can

6665
04:24:54,399 --> 04:24:55,760
still win and just don't give up

6666
04:24:55,760 --> 04:24:57,399
entirely that's good enough did you know

6667
04:24:57,399 --> 04:24:59,760
you're not the oldest uh TI play winner

6668
04:24:59,760 --> 04:25:01,439
anymore I know snaking is by a few

6669
04:25:01,439 --> 04:25:03,159
months by a few months were you

6670
04:25:03,159 --> 04:25:04,720
devastated when you heard the news I

6671
04:25:04,720 --> 04:25:07,040
mean he's taking everything from me

6672
04:25:07,040 --> 04:25:09,199
that's all I had left that was it that's

6673
04:25:09,199 --> 04:25:10,720
the only thing that was keeping you

6674
04:25:10,720 --> 04:25:13,479
going was being the oldest TI winner uh

6675
04:25:13,479 --> 04:25:15,040

6676
04:25:15,040 --> 04:25:16,720

tiny Airlines plays JX you're tiny in

6693
04:26:03,680 --> 04:26:06,800
general uh does it ever warm your heart

6694
04:26:06,800 --> 04:26:08,760
a little to see that play be pulled off

6695
04:26:08,760 --> 04:26:10,880
on a high State stage such as previous

6696
04:26:10,880 --> 04:26:14,239
TI when maybe SU to RZ or something yeah

6697
04:26:14,239 --> 04:26:17,279
sure uh make a trend you

6698
04:26:17,279 --> 04:26:19,000
know I'm going to have to startop

6699
04:26:19,000 --> 04:26:20,520
getting all the clips and then just put

6700
04:26:20,520 --> 04:26:23,279
# JX tiny aines next to it instead I'm

6701
04:26:23,279 --> 04:26:25,000
happy to see it anytime

6702
04:26:25,000 --> 04:26:28,520
so I love it look we get ning the grand

6703
04:26:28,520 --> 04:26:30,080
finals now okay we're only a couple

6704
04:26:30,080 --> 04:26:32,000
minutes away so I want to go back to the

6705
04:26:32,000 --> 04:26:33,600
teams that we want to focus on team

6706
04:26:33,600 --> 04:26:35,840
spirit gaming Gladiators here fear and

6707
04:26:35,840 --> 04:26:37,439
Jer this is mainly for you two because

6708
04:26:37,439 --> 04:26:39,199
they're such similar things and actually

6709
04:26:39,199 --> 04:26:41,880
you as well OE because that ti5 win for

6710
04:26:41,880 --> 04:26:44,080
you both both it was you in the upper

6711
04:26:44,080 --> 04:26:45,600
bracket you came to that lower bracket

6712
04:26:45,600 --> 04:26:47,319
and one day you had to go lower bracket

6713
04:26:47,319 --> 04:26:49,640
into Grand finals and you won it so your

6714
04:26:49,640 --> 04:26:51,520
advice but gaming Gladiators right now

6715
04:26:51,520 --> 04:26:53,239
what would it be how do you contain

6716
04:26:53,239 --> 04:26:55,359
these emotions and how do you persevere

6717
04:26:55,359 --> 04:26:57,040
through a potential best of

6718
04:26:57,040 --> 04:26:59,720
five I guess I'll start I suppose for so

6719
04:26:59,720 --> 04:27:01,239
we got knocked down by cedc and went

6720
04:27:01,239 --> 04:27:03,239
into the lower bracket we won that match

6721
04:27:03,239 --> 04:27:05,159
two I believe and then we went in I

6722
04:27:05,159 --> 04:27:07,239
think we just sure we lost to the team

6723
04:27:07,239 --> 04:27:09,359
beforehand but we knew we were better we

6724
04:27:09,359 --> 04:27:11,560
just had to make a couple adjustments

6725
04:27:11,560 --> 04:27:13,279
and if we just made those adjustments we

6726
04:27:13,279 --> 04:27:15,080
knew we had to take to win so it was

6727
04:27:15,080 --> 04:27:17,800
just confidence really and good

6728
04:27:17,800 --> 04:27:19,479
preparation do have anything else you

6729
04:27:19,479 --> 04:27:21,680
want to add on to into that one IE no

6730
04:27:21,680 --> 04:27:23,279
not really I think that sounds right

6731
04:27:23,279 --> 04:27:25,600
like you just go in I think Gladiators

6732
04:27:25,600 --> 04:27:27,040
they had a long run this TI you know

6733
04:27:27,040 --> 04:27:28,880
they got they start lower back after

6734
04:27:28,880 --> 04:27:30,319
losing to Talent they've come all this

6735
04:27:30,319 --> 04:27:32,880
way I think it's time like you put all

6736
04:27:32,880 --> 04:27:34,239
this work in you got all this experience

6737
04:27:34,239 --> 04:27:36,159
in the tournament they've grown a lot if

6738
04:27:36,159 --> 04:27:37,800
they feel confident they can just

6739
04:27:37,800 --> 04:27:39,560
execute that they should feel really

6740
04:27:39,560 --> 04:27:41,000
good about their Series so there weren't

6741
04:27:41,000 --> 04:27:42,399
actually that many nerves for you when

6742
04:27:42,399 --> 04:27:44,119
you were about to walk out after even

6743
04:27:44,119 --> 04:27:45,520
having played a series earlier do you

6744
04:27:45,520 --> 04:27:46,840
think the earlier series actually helped

6745
04:27:46,840 --> 04:27:48,840
you and could help gaming Gladiators I

6746
04:27:48,840 --> 04:27:49,920
thought it was good to play honestly

6747
04:27:49,920 --> 04:27:51,399
like you're all warmed up you have the

6748
04:27:51,399 --> 04:27:53,800
momentum going I feel like as long as

6749
04:27:53,800 --> 04:27:56,119
it's not like some I don't know like two

6750
04:27:56,119 --> 04:27:57,520
80 minute games that you just played

6751
04:27:57,520 --> 04:27:59,080
it's going to be really good for you

6752
04:27:59,080 --> 04:28:00,279
that's true where it's more as the the

6753
04:28:00,279 --> 04:28:01,800
40 minutes that we just previously saw

6754
04:28:01,800 --> 04:28:03,399
it's a bit better yeah I like it this is

6755
04:28:03,399 --> 04:28:05,199
where I say like every finals is going

6756
04:28:05,199 --> 04:28:06,960
to be different for everyone cuz we had

6757
04:28:06,960 --> 04:28:08,880
a unique situation where we scrim seedak

6758
04:28:08,880 --> 04:28:10,560
a lot we always beat them we lost them

6759
04:28:10,560 --> 04:28:12,760
that one time and then we had the right

6760
04:28:12,760 --> 04:28:14,920
strategy we had this one idea that we

6761
04:28:14,920 --> 04:28:16,720
went into and it worked and from there

6762
04:28:16,720 --> 04:28:19,080
it just felt easy okay and my one for

6763
04:28:19,080 --> 04:28:22,159
you JX is around team spirit winning it

6764
04:28:22,159 --> 04:28:24,399
a second time I I already asked you how

6765
04:28:24,399 --> 04:28:25,560
you felt there was that little bit of

6766
04:28:25,560 --> 04:28:26,600
frustration when you went through the

6767
04:28:26,600 --> 04:28:28,720
upper bracket so do you think that drive

6768
04:28:28,720 --> 04:28:30,479
right now is going to be higher than it

6769
04:28:30,479 --> 04:28:32,439
was in any other day to be able to win

6770
04:28:32,439 --> 04:28:35,080
DOTA right now I would imagine it's

6771
04:28:35,080 --> 04:28:37,239
actually harder to have Drive night now

6772
04:28:37,239 --> 04:28:38,880
uh and I think it's because the first

6773
04:28:38,880 --> 04:28:41,359
time it just feels so much more and I I

6774
04:28:41,359 --> 04:28:42,960
think if they can really tune into what

6775
04:28:42,960 --> 04:28:45,760
they felt back then and try to like

6776
04:28:45,760 --> 04:28:48,239
channel that same kind of environment as

6777
04:28:48,239 --> 04:28:49,800
a team I think that's what you're

6778
04:28:49,800 --> 04:28:51,080
looking for here just put it out of your

6779
04:28:51,080 --> 04:28:52,840
mind just think this is a redo of TI 10

6780
04:28:52,840 --> 04:28:53,920
if your team

6781
04:28:53,920 --> 04:28:57,159
spirit uh yeah yeah yeah just repeat

6782
04:28:57,159 --> 04:29:00,279
that's pretty much it vendy for you as

6783
04:29:00,279 --> 04:29:03,880
well uh I like that you're very aware of

6784
04:29:03,880 --> 04:29:05,199
everything else that's going around you

6785
04:29:05,199 --> 04:29:07,239
of this environment of the Arena of the

6786
04:29:07,239 --> 04:29:08,640
crowd I know that you love it I know

6787
04:29:08,640 --> 04:29:10,199
that they love you so for gaming

6788
04:29:10,199 --> 04:29:12,439
Gladiators and Teen Spirit again I ask

6789
04:29:12,439 --> 04:29:14,319
you what would you want to hear if you

6790
04:29:14,319 --> 04:29:15,640

Crowd knowing everyone was watching uh I

6793
04:29:20,359 --> 04:29:22,760

6896
04:37:26,000 --> 04:37:28,920

6897
04:37:28,920 --> 04:37:31,959
lacost by tlf by eie and I got to say it

6898
04:37:31,959 --> 04:37:35,480
eie he did it again ti10 he did it we

6902
04:37:42,359 --> 04:37:45,879
chills he shaved his head he sacrificed

6903
04:37:45,879 --> 04:37:48,760
his hair that is how he won TI 10 he

6904
04:37:48,760 --> 04:37:51,760
started the trend of going bald for TI

6905
04:37:51,760 --> 04:37:54,561
and he he came to win today I would be

6906
04:37:54,561 --> 04:37:56,920
worried if iway gaming Gladiators other

6907
04:37:56,920 --> 04:37:58,639

6908
04:37:58,639 --> 04:38:00,799

04:38:29,719 --> 04:38:31,279
think I think we got to give them huge

6924
04:38:31,279 --> 04:38:32,879
credit for what they managed to do with

6925
04:38:32,879 --> 04:38:34,320
the team because they managed to win

6926
04:38:34,320 --> 04:38:36,639
three Majors all upper bracket runs and

6927
04:38:36,639 --> 04:38:38,199
suddenly they're in the lower bracket

6928
04:38:38,199 --> 04:38:39,959
and we had an interview yesterday with

6929
04:38:39,959 --> 04:38:41,680
celer who talked about the importance of

6930
04:38:41,680 --> 04:38:43,600
the serious this serious the seating

6931
04:38:43,600 --> 04:38:45,639
match against ton how much they learned

6932
04:38:45,639 --> 04:38:47,520
from it and ever since that they're just

6933
04:38:47,520 --> 04:38:49,000
speeding things up this is the team that

6934
04:38:49,000 --> 04:38:51,080
can beat you 19 minutes we saw Flawless

6935
04:38:51,080 --> 04:38:53,279
performance yesterday against a ray they

6936
04:38:53,279 --> 04:38:55,119
were playing Turbo mode pretty much yeah

6937
04:38:55,119 --> 04:38:56,719
they really really were and we must not

6938
04:38:56,719 --> 04:38:59,639
forget a ground finals like these it is

6939
04:38:59,639 --> 04:39:02,160
not a crowning of a tournament not even

6940
04:39:02,160 --> 04:39:05,400
of the year it is a crown of a career

6941
04:39:05,400 --> 04:39:07,799
and we have seen most of these faces

6942
04:39:07,799 --> 04:39:10,000
lift the ages already t for L will be

6943
04:39:10,000 --> 04:39:11,959
the first time but they have tried so

6944
04:39:11,959 --> 04:39:13,959
many times they have and for La at least

6945
04:39:13,959 --> 04:39:15,600
last year he played on b boom he came

6946
04:39:15,600 --> 04:39:17,320
last place and now this time around he's

6947
04:39:17,320 --> 04:39:18,840
in the grand finals of course surrounded

6948
04:39:18,840 --> 04:39:20,959
by 4 Titi winners as well if they are to

6949
04:39:20,959 --> 04:39:23,039
lift this agis first time F second

6950
04:39:23,039 --> 04:39:24,959
attempt two time winners potentially for

6951
04:39:24,959 --> 04:39:26,719
the other four players it is incredibly

6952
04:39:26,719 --> 04:39:28,480
storyline of course but posco he's

6953
04:39:28,480 --> 04:39:30,160
attempted this eight times already sure

6954
04:39:30,160 --> 04:39:32,480
he's lifted the AIS once but Ace as well

6955
04:39:32,480 --> 04:39:34,320
he's attempted eight times but yet to

6956
04:39:34,320 --> 04:39:36,279
lift the agis can he do it himself this

6957
04:39:36,279 --> 04:39:38,878
time and Quinn let's not forget to talk

6958
04:39:38,878 --> 04:39:42,600
about Quinn seven attempts five TI

6959
04:39:42,600 --> 04:39:44,798
attempts everyone thought that Quinn you

6960
04:39:44,798 --> 04:39:46,480
know was just hanging around the na DOTA

6961
04:39:46,480 --> 04:39:48,440
scene wasn't going to make it very far

6962
04:39:48,440 --> 04:39:50,320
but he joined gaming Gladiators

6963
04:39:50,320 --> 04:39:52,480
something clicked and he proved to the

6964
04:39:52,480 --> 04:39:54,240
world the kind of caliber of player he

6965
04:39:54,240 --> 04:39:56,480
is he is world class he has been

6966
04:39:56,480 --> 04:39:59,040
destroying everyone in his way and he's

6967
04:39:59,040 --> 04:40:01,400
here for the Aegis lift he is here for

6968
04:40:01,400 --> 04:40:03,280
it we'll see which team will come out

6969
04:40:03,280 --> 04:40:05,040
Victorious of course on one side we have

6970
04:40:05,040 --> 04:40:07,920
a chance of four fresh two time

6971
04:40:07,920 --> 04:40:10,878
Champions on the side of team spirit but

6972
04:40:10,878 --> 04:40:13,560
gaming Gladiators they could be having

6973
04:40:13,560 --> 04:40:15,840
two crowning achievements in their

6974
04:40:15,840 --> 04:40:18,040
finals if they were to lift the ages

6975
04:40:18,040 --> 04:40:20,638
first one coming all the way starting

6976
04:40:20,638 --> 04:40:23,160
off in the lower brackety yeah I think

6977
04:40:23,160 --> 04:40:24,840
so ti9 liquid they got all the way to

6978
04:40:24,840 --> 04:40:26,240
the finals but weren't able to win it

6979
04:40:26,240 --> 04:40:27,798
but if gaming Gladiators are to win this

6980
04:40:27,798 --> 04:40:29,520
TI it'll be the first time a team starts

6981
04:40:29,520 --> 04:40:31,080
in the lower bracket and lifts the ages

6982
04:40:31,080 --> 04:40:32,878
that's six lower bracket games that they

6983
04:40:32,878 --> 04:40:34,798
have to win back time and time again and

6984
04:40:34,798 --> 04:40:37,120
not drop a single one and they could do

6985
04:40:37,120 --> 04:40:38,480
it that that's that's an incredible and

6986
04:40:38,480 --> 04:40:39,798
then also the fact they won three Majors

6987
04:40:39,798 --> 04:40:42,798
like so many things going their way yeah

6988
04:40:42,798 --> 04:40:45,000
I think L we've heard a lot about the

6989
04:40:45,000 --> 04:40:46,958
majors and they all went through the

6990
04:40:46,958 --> 04:40:48,480
upper bracket and people like well I

6991
04:40:48,480 --> 04:40:49,680
wonder how they fair in the lower

6992
04:40:49,680 --> 04:40:50,958
bracket you know everything's different

6993
04:40:50,958 --> 04:40:52,240
over there there's so much more pressure

6994
04:40:52,240 --> 04:40:54,798
but this team they Thrive under it

6995
04:40:54,798 --> 04:40:56,958
absolutely this is the team that powered

6996
04:40:56,958 --> 04:40:58,400
up the most I would say throughout the

6997
04:40:58,400 --> 04:41:00,480
whole tournament because this team is

6998
04:41:00,480 --> 04:41:01,760
not really familiar with the lower

6999
04:41:01,760 --> 04:41:03,120
bracket especially when it comes down to

7000
04:41:03,120 --> 04:41:05,920
the DPC and the tournament so really

7001
04:41:05,920 --> 04:41:07,400
glad that they're showing what they're

7002
04:41:07,400 --> 04:41:08,638
really made up they're going to their

7003
04:41:08,638 --> 04:41:10,638
own like how they started to dominate

7004
04:41:10,638 --> 04:41:12,600
the year with these like uh strength

7005
04:41:12,600 --> 04:41:15,080
Heroes these Aura buyers grouping

7006
04:41:15,080 --> 04:41:17,400
grouping up S5 and just complete

7007
04:41:17,400 --> 04:41:19,798
domination from start to finish I think

7008
04:41:19,798 --> 04:41:21,360
coming into this because they just

7009
04:41:21,360 --> 04:41:23,240
played two games I think they have

7010
04:41:23,240 --> 04:41:25,718
advantage and let's not forget gaming

7011
04:41:25,718 --> 04:41:27,520
Gladiators because of their dominance

7012
04:41:27,520 --> 04:41:29,560
this year they are the team that shaped

7013
04:41:29,560 --> 04:41:31,920
The Meta they are the team that got the

7014
04:41:31,920 --> 04:41:33,798
meta nerfed and changed to the way that

7015
04:41:33,798 --> 04:41:35,920
it is today so when the initial patch

7016
04:41:35,920 --> 04:41:37,560
happened they were the team that was hit

7017
04:41:37,560 --> 04:41:39,240
the hardest by it and it took them so

7018
04:41:39,240 --> 04:41:41,400
long to adjust everyone thought that

7019
04:41:41,400 --> 04:41:43,160
okay it's the ti curse if you're

7020
04:41:43,160 --> 04:41:44,878
dominant the entire year there's no way

7021
04:41:44,878 --> 04:41:47,120
you win there's no way you get this far

7022
04:41:47,120 --> 04:41:49,638
but they said what meta We Are The Meta

7023
04:41:49,638 --> 04:41:52,200
and they prove to everybody that they're

7024
04:41:52,200 --> 04:41:55,240
not just a patch team strong they're a

7025
04:41:55,240 --> 04:41:56,920
strong team and they're here to compete

7026
04:41:56,920 --> 04:41:58,840
and they have played the most games out

7027
04:41:58,840 --> 04:42:00,718
of everybody here going through the

7028
04:42:00,718 --> 04:42:02,280
lower bracket so it's not like they're

7029
04:42:02,280 --> 04:42:04,840
saving strats everybody knows what's

7030
04:42:04,840 --> 04:42:06,718
coming the question is how are you going

7031
04:42:06,718 --> 04:42:08,320
to answer that if you're team spirit I

7032
04:42:08,320 --> 04:42:10,360
hope they have something something very

7033
04:42:10,360 --> 04:42:12,400
special cooked up for this and this

7034
04:42:12,400 --> 04:42:14,040
series there's a little bit of a change

7035
04:42:14,040 --> 04:42:15,878
compared to all the series we saw before

7036
04:42:15,878 --> 04:42:18,718
it's a best of five and normally you've

7037
04:42:18,718 --> 04:42:20,600
got one team coming in thinking oh maybe

7038
04:42:20,600 --> 04:42:22,040
they don't have a lot of experience with

7039
04:42:22,040 --> 04:42:23,480
best of fives and actually taking them

7040
04:42:23,480 --> 04:42:26,320
in the end but both of these teams T

7041
04:42:26,320 --> 04:42:28,200
have shown that the adaptation that is

7042
04:42:28,200 --> 04:42:30,320
needed in a series like this they got it

7043
04:42:30,320 --> 04:42:31,160
yeah and not only they have the

7044
04:42:31,160 --> 04:42:32,958
adaptation but kind of play Styles

7045
04:42:32,958 --> 04:42:34,360
mirror as well like the spirit they're a

7046
04:42:34,360 --> 04:42:36,440
team that have been behind quite a lot

7047
04:42:36,440 --> 04:42:38,000
to come back into their games and then

7048
04:42:38,000 --> 04:42:39,480
for game of Gladiators you mentioned

7049
04:42:39,480 --> 04:42:41,200
that they played the most games 24 games

7050
04:42:41,200 --> 04:42:44,000
their average win time is 36 minutes

7051
04:42:44,000 --> 04:42:45,480
that's 10 minutes quicker than team

7052
04:42:45,480 --> 04:42:47,360
spirit so it really feels like this

7053
04:42:47,360 --> 04:42:48,958
whole series will be can Spirit survive

7054
04:42:48,958 --> 04:42:50,920
the onslaught of gaming can they find

7055
04:42:50,920 --> 04:42:52,480
those moments of collapse Brilliance to

7056
04:42:52,480 --> 04:42:54,320
get back into their games and then close

7057
04:42:54,320 --> 04:42:56,680
out like this is just two so different

7058
04:42:56,680 --> 04:42:58,638
teams it's like a beautiful finals two

7059
04:42:58,638 --> 04:43:00,040
different styles because gaming gladers

7060
04:43:00,040 --> 04:43:01,840
they've been so dominating and everybody

7061
04:43:01,840 --> 04:43:03,920
was focused on them starting from like

7062
04:43:03,920 --> 04:43:05,520
the laning stage one of the best you

7063
04:43:05,520 --> 04:43:06,878
know everybody was also talking about

7064
04:43:06,878 --> 04:43:09,040
the bed boom as a strong laning stage

7065
04:43:09,040 --> 04:43:10,958
team but team spirit when it comes down

7066
04:43:10,958 --> 04:43:13,120
to the late game decision making the way

7067
04:43:13,120 --> 04:43:14,840
they're making their plays they're just

7068
04:43:14,840 --> 04:43:16,760
topnotch I I think when it comes down to

7069
04:43:16,760 --> 04:43:18,400
super late game team spirit is the best

7070
04:43:18,400 --> 04:43:20,000
team in the world they got to get there

7071
04:43:20,000 --> 04:43:21,600
first though a lot of teams have failed

7072
04:43:21,600 --> 04:43:24,638
to do so against gaming Gladiators I

7073
04:43:24,638 --> 04:43:26,120
think that one thing that I've noticed

7074
04:43:26,120 --> 04:43:27,840
over the last few days is that there has

7075
04:43:27,840 --> 04:43:29,840
been a lot of talk about the offlaners

7076
04:43:29,840 --> 04:43:32,718
Fe I feel like we're seeing them be put

7077
04:43:32,718 --> 04:43:34,638
in the role to be the star player for

7078
04:43:34,638 --> 04:43:37,280
their squad yeah I mean when you look at

7079
04:43:37,280 --> 04:43:39,878
uh gaming Gladiators offliner Ace he is

7080
04:43:39,878 --> 04:43:42,360
the rock of this team he is their stable

7081
04:43:42,360 --> 04:43:44,000
player he is the one that they can

7082
04:43:44,000 --> 04:43:45,638
depend on the one that they build around

7083
04:43:45,638 --> 04:43:47,798
he's the player that enables Daio to

7084
04:43:47,798 --> 04:43:50,400
play in the hyper aggressive sometimes

7085
04:43:50,400 --> 04:43:53,240
very risky sometimes very dangerous way

7086
04:43:53,240 --> 04:43:55,080
that he plays but he makes it work

7087
04:43:55,080 --> 04:43:56,600
because their offlane the offlane of

7088
04:43:56,600 --> 04:43:58,840
tofu plus Ace is so strong they're

7089
04:43:58,840 --> 04:44:00,520
dominant he picks Heroes that rallies

7090
04:44:00,520 --> 04:44:02,718
his team into the game and he never

7091
04:44:02,718 --> 04:44:04,878
disappoints I've hardly ever seen Ace

7092
04:44:04,878 --> 04:44:07,320
have a bad game whereas collaps he also

7093
04:44:07,320 --> 04:44:09,280
fits that role in a similar way where he

7094
04:44:09,280 --> 04:44:10,920
is the playmaker of this team and him

7095
04:44:10,920 --> 04:44:12,680
and mea have been playing together for

7096
04:44:12,680 --> 04:44:16,120
as long as tofu and Ace have but the

7097
04:44:16,120 --> 04:44:18,000
special thing to me about collapse is

7098
04:44:18,000 --> 04:44:19,560
regardless of what situation you put him

7099
04:44:19,560 --> 04:44:21,520
in even if he has a bad net worth lead

7100
04:44:21,520 --> 04:44:23,718
even if his Lane goes poorly he finds

7101
04:44:23,718 --> 04:44:25,520
the initiation I mean I think collapse

7102
04:44:25,520 --> 04:44:27,680
is the best initiator DOTA two has ever

7103
04:44:27,680 --> 04:44:30,040
seen yeah collapse has been showing

7104
04:44:30,040 --> 04:44:31,920
fantastic work he he brought the Magnus

7105
04:44:31,920 --> 04:44:34,240
out again I think that's it must be it's

7106
04:44:34,240 --> 04:44:36,760
it's at this point it's a mental story

7107
04:44:36,760 --> 04:44:38,840
for the Magnus to be played by collapse

7108
04:44:38,840 --> 04:44:39,760
yeah I mean we're probably going to see

7109
04:44:39,760 --> 04:44:41,320
collapse at least once in this finals I

7110
04:44:41,320 --> 04:44:42,718
want to see at least one ax in this

7111
04:44:42,718 --> 04:44:46,920
finals um Mars the is it unpicked still

7112
04:44:46,920 --> 04:44:48,480
yeah it's pretty it's unpicked but it

7113
04:44:48,480 --> 04:44:50,160
has been banned a couple times if we get

7114
04:44:50,160 --> 04:44:51,440
to see that as well but there's so many

7115
04:44:51,440 --> 04:44:52,680
Specialties and I think that e

7116
04:44:52,680 --> 04:44:53,920
mentioning is beautiful it's like

7117
04:44:53,920 --> 04:44:55,400
collaps is the initiator he's the one

7118
04:44:55,400 --> 04:44:56,718
that is the one that always needs to

7119
04:44:56,718 --> 04:44:58,160
start the fight but Ace he plays quite

7120
04:44:58,160 --> 04:44:59,680
different in his offlane style where he

7121
04:44:59,680 --> 04:45:01,360
wants people to group around him so he's

7122
04:45:01,360 --> 04:45:02,760
not starting the fight through literally

7123
04:45:02,760 --> 04:45:04,080
initiating he just more like I'm going

7124
04:45:04,080 --> 04:45:06,000
to be in the position where I'll forc

7125
04:45:06,000 --> 04:45:07,680
the fight and that kind of differences

7126
04:45:07,680 --> 04:45:08,798
could be something that they try to

7127
04:45:08,798 --> 04:45:10,320
exploit between the two off laners in

7128
04:45:10,320 --> 04:45:11,878
this series and in this series we're

7129
04:45:11,878 --> 04:45:13,600
going to see gaming Gladiators go up

7130
04:45:13,600 --> 04:45:15,840
against team spirit and that means that

7131
04:45:15,840 --> 04:45:18,000
throughout this entire series we want to

7132
04:45:18,000 --> 04:45:20,798
we want to learn more and more about all

7133
04:45:20,798 --> 04:45:22,560
10 players and their coaches on stage

7134
04:45:22,560 --> 04:45:23,600
and we're going to start right now by

7135
04:45:23,600 --> 04:45:27,000
learning a little bit more about team

7136
04:45:28,270 --> 04:45:31,979
[Music]

7137
04:45:33,958 --> 04:45:36,638
spirit I think team spirit probably has

7138
04:45:36,638 --> 04:45:39,360
the best understanding of how to win a

7139
04:45:39,360 --> 04:45:41,760
game from any point

7140
04:45:41,760 --> 04:45:43,638
they prove again and again that they can

7141
04:45:43,638 --> 04:45:46,240
they can be behind for 20 minutes 30

7142
04:45:46,240 --> 04:45:48,280
minutes and then they can just like

7143
04:45:48,280 --> 04:45:50,798
really sit and wait and be patient and

7144
04:45:50,798 --> 04:45:52,200
all of a sudden they hit their timing or

7145
04:45:52,200 --> 04:45:54,320
they see an angle to to kind of to kind

7146
04:45:54,320 --> 04:45:56,520
of turn the game around and they do it

7147
04:45:56,520 --> 04:45:58,440
what I might the most about team spirit

7148
04:45:58,440 --> 04:46:01,600
is their team fight execution like when

7149
04:46:01,600 --> 04:46:04,320
it comes to little skirmishes late game

7150
04:46:04,320 --> 04:46:06,920
fights playing around Ops and vision

7151
04:46:06,920 --> 04:46:08,760
they really excel at that and for some

7152
04:46:08,760 --> 04:46:11,560
reason when they are uh High state

7153
04:46:11,560 --> 04:46:14,400
they really know how to perform now K

7154
04:46:14,400 --> 04:46:17,000
shows up finds immediately onto him yo

7155
04:46:17,000 --> 04:46:20,878
dies but the it's almost enough it is

7156
04:46:20,878 --> 04:46:23,200
and I think against them you can't

7157
04:46:23,200 --> 04:46:25,520
really afford to be salty uh because

7158
04:46:25,520 --> 04:46:26,958
anytime you make a mistake against them

7159
04:46:26,958 --> 04:46:30,400
I think they they punish you severely uh

7160
04:46:30,400 --> 04:46:31,920
and I also think individually they're

7161
04:46:31,920 --> 04:46:35,280
amazing I think yor is you know he's up

7162
04:46:35,280 --> 04:46:38,240
there with with the best of him uh he's

7163
04:46:38,240 --> 04:46:41,000
he's so consistent and yeah always

7164
04:46:41,000 --> 04:46:42,360
always delivers and I think they're

7165
04:46:42,360 --> 04:46:45,240
Supporting Cast uh the four rest of them

7166
04:46:45,240 --> 04:46:46,680
combin really well to to make space for

7167
04:46:46,680 --> 04:46:48,638
him and enable him and yeah they're just

7168
04:46:48,638 --> 04:46:53,360
a very well jelled uh kind of

7169
04:46:54,180 --> 04:46:59,119
[Music]

7170
04:47:02,080 --> 04:47:09,280
team team spirit versus gaming

7171
04:47:09,280 --> 04:47:11,718
Gladiators Grand and

7172
04:47:11,718 --> 04:47:13,670
Finals game

7173
04:47:13,670 --> 04:47:15,400
[Applause]

7174
04:47:15,400 --> 04:47:17,760
one it's big brain time everybody

7175
04:47:17,760 --> 04:47:19,718
Welcome to the draft panel for the grand

7176
04:47:19,718 --> 04:47:22,160
finals you heard AI you heard dendy you

7177
04:47:22,160 --> 04:47:24,160
heard fear earlier talk about you know

7178
04:47:24,160 --> 04:47:26,120
previous experience with ti finals now

7179
04:47:26,120 --> 04:47:27,718
it's time to get into the nitty-gritty

7180
04:47:27,718 --> 04:47:29,440
of this one you guys you've been there

7181
04:47:29,440 --> 04:47:30,798
before you know what the stakes are you

7182
04:47:30,798 --> 04:47:33,920
know what to do so let's get going um

7183
04:47:33,920 --> 04:47:35,240
these two teams have had very different

7184
04:47:35,240 --> 04:47:36,840
styles as was pointed out by the panel

7185
04:47:36,840 --> 04:47:39,558
going into this uh this Grand finals

7186
04:47:39,558 --> 04:47:41,200
what are you guys looking for who's

7187
04:47:41,200 --> 04:47:43,200
going to throw the first curve ball it's

7188
04:47:43,200 --> 04:47:44,718
a good question I think the one thing

7189
04:47:44,718 --> 04:47:46,240
that you do really have to look out for

7190
04:47:46,240 --> 04:47:48,440
is going to be the Magnus right it's

7191
04:47:48,440 --> 04:47:50,638
collabs Magnus he only just showed it

7192
04:47:50,638 --> 04:47:52,680
yesterday his first time playing it and

7193
04:47:52,680 --> 04:47:54,520
this is what they won TI 10 off this is

7194
04:47:54,520 --> 04:47:56,160
something you've got to be afraid of do

7195
04:47:56,160 --> 04:47:57,558
you have the confidence if you're gaming

7196
04:47:57,558 --> 04:47:59,040
gliders to leave in the pool that's what

7197
04:47:59,040 --> 04:48:01,840
I'm mainly looking for in this series uh

7198
04:48:01,840 --> 04:48:04,240
I'm I'm looking at how both Styles going

7199
04:48:04,240 --> 04:48:07,958
to co and uh you know meet each other in

7200
04:48:07,958 --> 04:48:11,480
terms of like uh gaming GL where

7201
04:48:11,480 --> 04:48:14,760
apply a lot of pressure on all stages of

7202
04:48:14,760 --> 04:48:16,280
game especially starting from early we

7203
04:48:16,280 --> 04:48:19,240
have very strong Lanes very Tempo drafts

7204
04:48:19,240 --> 04:48:22,320
and as pel said like team spirit we have

7205
04:48:22,320 --> 04:48:24,360
longer games when we win so I'm curious

7206
04:48:24,360 --> 04:48:26,040
if we come up with some ideas and plan

7207
04:48:26,040 --> 04:48:28,718
how to stop it how we're going to deal

7208
04:48:28,718 --> 04:48:31,280
with man collapse apparently On

7209
04:48:31,280 --> 04:48:32,878
LAN

7210
04:48:32,878 --> 04:48:35,520
yeah yeah I think uh team spirit they

7211
04:48:35,520 --> 04:48:36,878
have a lot of info on gaming gliders

7212
04:48:36,878 --> 04:48:38,080
they watch so many other the games they

7213
04:48:38,080 --> 04:48:39,680
have a lot of data there I think

7214
04:48:39,680 --> 04:48:41,160
honestly going into the best of you have

7215
04:48:41,160 --> 04:48:43,040
a lot of games you have some room for

7216
04:48:43,040 --> 04:48:44,600
not experimentation but to test your

7217
04:48:44,600 --> 04:48:46,240
limits I think they should sort of try

7218
04:48:46,240 --> 04:48:48,080
to pick a gaming glider strategy that

7219
04:48:48,080 --> 04:48:49,878
they want to play against where the an

7220
04:48:49,878 --> 04:48:52,200
Chen pangier necro and they should try

7221
04:48:52,200 --> 04:48:53,680
to break that early in the bestel 5 I

7222
04:48:53,680 --> 04:48:54,920
think that's what gives them the best

7223
04:48:54,920 --> 04:48:56,878
shot of like sort of getting a draft

7224
04:48:56,878 --> 04:48:59,040
advantage in the series it sounds like a

7225
04:48:59,040 --> 04:49:00,120
lot of the heroes you're talking about

7226
04:49:00,120 --> 04:49:02,480
overlap with are healing based ancient

7227
04:49:02,480 --> 04:49:03,878
apparation still in the pool is that a

7228
04:49:03,878 --> 04:49:05,480
potential overall first pick for team

7229
04:49:05,480 --> 04:49:07,600
spirit do you think that's a an angle to

7230
04:49:07,600 --> 04:49:09,558
try to to Target what gaming gliders

7231
04:49:09,558 --> 04:49:10,798
have been running I would really like

7232
04:49:10,798 --> 04:49:12,240
like the a I think MOS is actually the

7233
04:49:12,240 --> 04:49:13,760
first player to start playing a I think

7234
04:49:13,760 --> 04:49:15,400
he was playing a bit before R and pubs

7235
04:49:15,400 --> 04:49:17,160
and they even ran a couple official they

7236
04:49:17,160 --> 04:49:19,520
actually go with the Weaver which I mean

7237
04:49:19,520 --> 04:49:21,080
it's a bit flexible but honestly I'm a

7238
04:49:21,080 --> 04:49:22,680
bit surprised I thought this Weaver it's

7239
04:49:22,680 --> 04:49:24,558
a bit weaker into sort of gaming gladi

7240
04:49:24,558 --> 04:49:26,040
Ball but what it can do is it can break

7241
04:49:26,040 --> 04:49:27,680
down the laning stage a lot if you get

7242
04:49:27,680 --> 04:49:29,160
ahead of these ball lineups into Lanes

7243
04:49:29,160 --> 04:49:30,878
often times they can't group up in this

7244
04:49:30,878 --> 04:49:33,160
way that they want to yeah the way I

7245
04:49:33,160 --> 04:49:34,920
look at this Weaver a little bit is team

7246
04:49:34,920 --> 04:49:36,440
Spirits they're playing against gaming

7247
04:49:36,440 --> 04:49:38,480
gladi right and what I've noticed a lot

7248
04:49:38,480 --> 04:49:40,718
from gaming gladers right now is you

7249
04:49:40,718 --> 04:49:43,240
want Dau on the CK or Weaver so they ban

7250
04:49:43,240 --> 04:49:46,600
the CK they B they take the Weaver away

7251
04:49:46,600 --> 04:49:48,760
and datu's he's really good but he's

7252
04:49:48,760 --> 04:49:50,120
really good at playing these aggressive

7253
04:49:50,120 --> 04:49:51,638
stle carries that's mainly because we

7254
04:49:51,638 --> 04:49:53,480
see Ace playing a little bit greedy too

7255
04:49:53,480 --> 04:49:55,360
right so drao can play a little bit

7256
04:49:55,360 --> 04:49:57,200
faster so I think this is very targeted

7257
04:49:57,200 --> 04:49:59,400
to just take it away from gaming

7258
04:49:59,400 --> 04:50:03,480
gladers yeah both teams have uh very

7259
04:50:03,480 --> 04:50:06,200
similar like three course idea which all

7260
04:50:06,200 --> 04:50:08,680
threee cor is getting big but compared

7261
04:50:08,680 --> 04:50:10,760
for example to gaming the ru is doing

7262
04:50:10,760 --> 04:50:13,480
more space creating stuff and in team

7263
04:50:13,480 --> 04:50:15,320
Spirits it's Soo so it's a little bit

7264
04:50:15,320 --> 04:50:16,680
different for both teams so it's very

7265
04:50:16,680 --> 04:50:18,520
interesting that team spirit is stealing

7266
04:50:18,520 --> 04:50:21,240
this Weaver away like from Gladiators

7267
04:50:21,240 --> 04:50:23,878
and yoro played an amazing Weaver like a

7268
04:50:23,878 --> 04:50:26,480
few days ago like it was very very

7269
04:50:26,480 --> 04:50:28,520
strong I think we might be seeing a Toro

7270
04:50:28,520 --> 04:50:29,718
on Weaver youan on here as like

7271
04:50:29,718 --> 04:50:31,320
bloodseeker I think the support Weaver

7272
04:50:31,320 --> 04:50:32,878
like I mean you care about rupture but

7273
04:50:32,878 --> 04:50:34,080
then you're just rupturing a support I

7274
04:50:34,080 --> 04:50:35,240
think you would only ban this type of

7275
04:50:35,240 --> 04:50:36,718
hero if you want to play the Weaver on

7276
04:50:36,718 --> 04:50:39,280
core T was also getting like his 89th

7277
04:50:39,280 --> 04:50:41,600
Mor game of the tourament so I think

7278
04:50:41,600 --> 04:50:43,240
that's like gaming gladers they should

7279
04:50:43,240 --> 04:50:44,558
actually feel really comfortable right

7280
04:50:44,558 --> 04:50:46,160
now with this opening I guess another

7281
04:50:46,160 --> 04:50:47,480
thing about the bloodseeker band is that

7282
04:50:47,480 --> 04:50:49,120
it kind of feeds into gaming glider's

7283
04:50:49,120 --> 04:50:50,638
General approach to the game in terms of

7284
04:50:50,638 --> 04:50:52,000
pace right this is a very aggressive

7285
04:50:52,000 --> 04:50:53,840
carry that wants to fight and bring that

7286
04:50:53,840 --> 04:50:56,040
pressure early uh it doesn't mind diving

7287
04:50:56,040 --> 04:50:57,958
Towers which I would say game gliders

7288
04:50:57,958 --> 04:50:59,200
have done more than any team in this

7289
04:50:59,200 --> 04:51:01,958
tournament so it's very clear here that

7290
04:51:01,958 --> 04:51:03,400
the teams are targeting different

7291
04:51:03,400 --> 04:51:04,760
players you pointed out you're Banning

7292
04:51:04,760 --> 04:51:05,920
carries when you're Spirit here and

7293
04:51:05,920 --> 04:51:08,200
you're stealing one away whereas as as

7294
04:51:08,200 --> 04:51:10,000
Denny was talking about laurl is playing

7295
04:51:10,000 --> 04:51:11,920
more of the aggressive style for for

7296
04:51:11,920 --> 04:51:13,280
team spirit do you think gaming

7297
04:51:13,280 --> 04:51:16,120
Gladiators would be wise to try to match

7298
04:51:16,120 --> 04:51:19,040
that idea so to speak by targeting LL as

7299
04:51:19,040 --> 04:51:21,360
much as Spirit are targeting um Doro

7300
04:51:21,360 --> 04:51:24,360
here I think uh the best idea would be

7301
04:51:24,360 --> 04:51:26,718
to pick extremely strong laner for Queen

7302
04:51:26,718 --> 04:51:28,558
which usually Gaming Goat is do in every

7303
04:51:28,558 --> 04:51:30,360
game and it working perfectly because

7304
04:51:30,360 --> 04:51:32,080
Queen is one of the best laners out

7305
04:51:32,080 --> 04:51:35,200
there for sure without D so I think this

7306
04:51:35,200 --> 04:51:38,360
this is a part of a uh plan which should

7307
04:51:38,360 --> 04:51:40,840
be to look down a little bit on W so he

7308
04:51:40,840 --> 04:51:43,400
doesn't have a good game yeah I think if

7309
04:51:43,400 --> 04:51:44,638
they go with that plan they can probably

7310
04:51:44,638 --> 04:51:46,000
look for the enchantress here I'm

7311
04:51:46,000 --> 04:51:47,480
honestly surprised that they're giving

7312
04:51:47,480 --> 04:51:49,480
it to Gladiators on second phase I think

7313
04:51:49,480 --> 04:51:51,680
both en and Chen are two Heroes that if

7314
04:51:51,680 --> 04:51:52,680
you have the winning mid you can

7315
04:51:52,680 --> 04:51:55,000
snowball a match up really hard yeah

7316
04:51:55,000 --> 04:51:56,320
it's one of the best heroes to rotate

7317
04:51:56,320 --> 04:51:58,480
for 5 minutes seon create insane amount

7318
04:51:58,480 --> 04:52:01,360
of pressure and we saw how gaming lators

7319
04:52:01,360 --> 04:52:03,798
to taking Towers from their enemies like

7320
04:52:03,798 --> 04:52:05,360
if you look almost every game like

7321
04:52:05,360 --> 04:52:07,878
minute 10 12 there is no tier one Towers

7322
04:52:07,878 --> 04:52:10,520
on all three lanes so it's crazy yeah

7323
04:52:10,520 --> 04:52:11,638
yeah I think just going into the series

7324
04:52:11,638 --> 04:52:13,840
in general gaming gladers they like tofu

7325
04:52:13,840 --> 04:52:15,680
playing this Mor because gives Ace a

7326
04:52:15,680 --> 04:52:17,400
good game they can get the enchanters

7327
04:52:17,400 --> 04:52:18,840
you mentioned that way they can Snowball

7328
04:52:18,840 --> 04:52:21,520
the game it's very clear how G wants to

7329
04:52:21,520 --> 04:52:23,320
play they're going to want to play fast

7330
04:52:23,320 --> 04:52:25,120
if you be greedy they want to punish it

7331
04:52:25,120 --> 04:52:27,280
right away and team they seem a bit more

7332
04:52:27,280 --> 04:52:28,520
flexible on what they want to do in

7333
04:52:28,520 --> 04:52:29,840
their draft and they kind of want to

7334
04:52:29,840 --> 04:52:31,520
just take strategy away and they're

7335
04:52:31,520 --> 04:52:33,718
versatile enough to do it this is a

7336
04:52:33,718 --> 04:52:35,480
quite the curveball right picking hango

7337
04:52:35,480 --> 04:52:37,400
in this slot is very early on in the

7338
04:52:37,400 --> 04:52:39,718
draft uh as much as I'm sure all the

7339
04:52:39,718 --> 04:52:41,440
meme enjoyers out there are happy to see

7340
04:52:41,440 --> 04:52:43,558
Quinn play the Pango for the nth time

7341
04:52:43,558 --> 04:52:46,400
this tournament um you're effectively

7342
04:52:46,400 --> 04:52:48,200
offering team spirit the possibility of

7343
04:52:48,200 --> 04:52:50,958
truly counterpicking mid here we've seen

7344
04:52:50,958 --> 04:52:52,760
uh Laurel and a hero such as Dazzle

7345
04:52:52,760 --> 04:52:54,798
destroy mid melee Heroes is that a good

7346
04:52:54,798 --> 04:52:56,040
match up against Pango or is he one of

7347
04:52:56,040 --> 04:52:57,798
the heroes that can kind of float that

7348
04:52:57,798 --> 04:53:00,080
lane uh it's pretty good Daz is

7349
04:53:00,080 --> 04:53:02,480
destroying almost every M Hero on Lane

7350
04:53:02,480 --> 04:53:04,520
but I don't think that team spirit want

7351
04:53:04,520 --> 04:53:06,920
to go for that puff because that will uh

7352
04:53:06,920 --> 04:53:09,040
switch them from the more of a comfort

7353
04:53:09,040 --> 04:53:11,520
strategy even F I'm pretty sure we can

7354
04:53:11,520 --> 04:53:14,320
uh make it but uh yeah like we putting

7355
04:53:14,320 --> 04:53:17,718
water in a situation where uh I think we

7356
04:53:17,718 --> 04:53:19,400
will need to decide with more limited

7357
04:53:19,400 --> 04:53:21,120
like hero pool against this Pango

7358
04:53:21,120 --> 04:53:22,638
because you want to punish this hero but

7359
04:53:22,638 --> 04:53:25,280
at the same time uh what kind of Heroes

7360
04:53:25,280 --> 04:53:28,760
left here to punish it from uh comfort

7361
04:53:28,760 --> 04:53:30,600
zone yeah it's definitely a little bit

7362
04:53:30,600 --> 04:53:32,718
different cuz like if I'm Weaver in this

7363
04:53:32,718 --> 04:53:34,680
situation I don't find Pango to be an

7364
04:53:34,680 --> 04:53:36,920
issue for me right like you can get away

7365
04:53:36,920 --> 04:53:38,680
should Pango for sure yeah yeah and then

7366
04:53:38,680 --> 04:53:40,000
now you get the tree to lock down the

7367
04:53:40,000 --> 04:53:41,760
Pango and the these earlier fights and

7368
04:53:41,760 --> 04:53:42,840
also you get a counter pick in the

7369
04:53:42,840 --> 04:53:45,240
lightning stage so it's already not a

7370
04:53:45,240 --> 04:53:46,840
good Pango game by any means but they're

7371
04:53:46,840 --> 04:53:49,040
just showing that Quinn is just super

7372
04:53:49,040 --> 04:53:51,320
confident on this hero and that's about

7373
04:53:51,320 --> 04:53:53,798
it for me on this pick okay here I can

7374
04:53:53,798 --> 04:53:56,840
talk a lot or I can just be quiet I I

7375
04:53:56,840 --> 04:53:59,558
played around 80 games last month of PK

7376
04:53:59,558 --> 04:54:01,798
and I enjoy this hero a lot and I really

7377
04:54:01,798 --> 04:54:05,160
like how L played even though he have a

7378
04:54:05,160 --> 04:54:07,480
bit different uh interesting ideas on it

7379
04:54:07,480 --> 04:54:09,958
like it's uh he's wishing to physical

7380
04:54:09,958 --> 04:54:11,920
car and it's actually pretty good answer

7381
04:54:11,920 --> 04:54:14,200
to Pango because for p you cannot win

7382
04:54:14,200 --> 04:54:17,280
your lane but if you do 50/50 you're

7383
04:54:17,280 --> 04:54:19,160
very happy and Pango one of those Heroes

7384
04:54:19,160 --> 04:54:21,798
that you can do actually 50/50 nowadays

7385
04:54:21,798 --> 04:54:24,558
so I believe it's great answer uh in

7386
04:54:24,558 --> 04:54:27,920
addition to uh against Pango against m

7387
04:54:27,920 --> 04:54:29,520
is tricky

7388
04:54:29,520 --> 04:54:31,718
but honestly I'm a bit worried for the

7389
04:54:31,718 --> 04:54:33,160
lane I feel like quid has played this

7390
04:54:33,160 --> 04:54:35,878
matchup like every single Pub since he

7391
04:54:35,878 --> 04:54:38,040
picks Pango every single game but I

7392
04:54:38,040 --> 04:54:39,558
think Puck he has like Zero armor right

7393
04:54:39,558 --> 04:54:40,920
once you get level three angle you start

7394
04:54:40,920 --> 04:54:43,480
spamming him I think it's a very very SC

7395
04:54:43,480 --> 04:54:46,200
dependent match up and team spirit stat

7396
04:54:46,200 --> 04:54:48,360
what I'm looking for at from them is I

7397
04:54:48,360 --> 04:54:49,558
think they watched the liquid series

7398
04:54:49,558 --> 04:54:51,080
that gliders played and that's the

7399
04:54:51,080 --> 04:54:52,558
series where gliders look the most

7400
04:54:52,558 --> 04:54:54,200
vulnerable and liquid strategy coming

7401
04:54:54,200 --> 04:54:56,080
into that was picking as strong a safe

7402
04:54:56,080 --> 04:54:57,520
Lane as you can so that's why they pick

7403
04:54:57,520 --> 04:54:59,280
the trient this Weaver might be carry

7404
04:54:59,280 --> 04:55:01,120
I'm not too sure the match up against L

7405
04:55:01,120 --> 04:55:02,638
at all but I assume it's fine for Weaver

7406
04:55:02,638 --> 04:55:05,360
L is sort of a scary laner but I'm not

7407
04:55:05,360 --> 04:55:07,160
too sure if like Puck fits into that

7408
04:55:07,160 --> 04:55:08,360
that well because if you're shutting

7409
04:55:08,360 --> 04:55:10,680
down the safe Lane

7410
04:55:10,680 --> 04:55:12,840
like I don't know like I'm not the

7411
04:55:12,840 --> 04:55:14,200
biggest fan of the puck hero I think he

7412
04:55:14,200 --> 04:55:16,120
sort of lacks some damage and I feel

7413
04:55:16,120 --> 04:55:17,520
like he's a hero that can actually get

7414
04:55:17,520 --> 04:55:20,240
run over on Mid uh absolutely what can

7415
04:55:20,240 --> 04:55:22,600
happen this hero cannot is not very

7416
04:55:22,600 --> 04:55:24,320
effective into helping Sidelines so you

7417
04:55:24,320 --> 04:55:25,638
really need to make sure your Sidelines

7418
04:55:25,638 --> 04:55:27,638
are extremely strong because he's just

7419
04:55:27,638 --> 04:55:29,400
you know getting bigger himself and

7420
04:55:29,400 --> 04:55:32,000
actually Puck is uh getting strong now

7421
04:55:32,000 --> 04:55:36,000
more late game so um I also agree with

7422
04:55:36,000 --> 04:55:38,400
uh it's kind of like might be a problem

7423
04:55:38,400 --> 04:55:41,320
to stop gaming Gladiators like fresh

7424
04:55:41,320 --> 04:55:43,040
because it's not a hero with stopping

7425
04:55:43,040 --> 04:55:45,680
pressure for sure so for a lot of teams

7426
04:55:45,680 --> 04:55:46,878
I feel like this L TR could be

7427
04:55:46,878 --> 04:55:48,718
considered a flex here between caran off

7428
04:55:48,718 --> 04:55:50,480
Lane I don't think we've seen Doro play

7429
04:55:50,480 --> 04:55:53,360
lre this tournament at all right no

7430
04:55:53,360 --> 04:55:56,000
saying that so does that mean what angle

7431
04:55:56,000 --> 04:55:57,280
could team spirit take here are you

7432
04:55:57,280 --> 04:55:58,920
trying to now specifically counter an

7433
04:55:58,920 --> 04:56:00,638
offlane loan Dr because you could put

7434
04:56:00,638 --> 04:56:02,040
the Weaver on support like AI was

7435
04:56:02,040 --> 04:56:03,480
pointing out or you kind of committed at

7436
04:56:03,480 --> 04:56:05,920
this point to putting a carry cuz in

7437
04:56:05,920 --> 04:56:07,798
reality is there a safe Lane hero that

7438
04:56:07,798 --> 04:56:09,680
can truly challenge l in the lane

7439
04:56:09,680 --> 04:56:11,320
together with tri is that possible I

7440
04:56:11,320 --> 04:56:13,000
think Weaver's fine and I think you pick

7441
04:56:13,000 --> 04:56:14,798
the strongest off laner here most likely

7442
04:56:14,798 --> 04:56:16,958
cuz they're going to Target it next so

7443
04:56:16,958 --> 04:56:18,638
like the Weaver tree match up versus

7444
04:56:18,638 --> 04:56:20,160
lone drud it should be perfectly fine

7445
04:56:20,160 --> 04:56:22,440
cuz one rotation or if you manage to get

7446
04:56:22,440 --> 04:56:24,200
on top of the lone dr's real hero and

7447
04:56:24,200 --> 04:56:26,000
you suuchi in with bugs he could die

7448
04:56:26,000 --> 04:56:27,920
pretty easily but lone no one's going to

7449
04:56:27,920 --> 04:56:29,680
like just straight out out CSS Z that's

7450
04:56:29,680 --> 04:56:31,160
why he's so strong in the landing stage

7451
04:56:31,160 --> 04:56:32,360
but there's definitely threat to kill

7452
04:56:32,360 --> 04:56:33,840
him and Weaver doesn't have problems

7453
04:56:33,840 --> 04:56:36,000
like csing cuz you have the gyate attack

7454
04:56:36,000 --> 04:56:37,680
you also have like the aikuchi you're

7455
04:56:37,680 --> 04:56:39,280
going to get csing just fine against the

7456
04:56:39,280 --> 04:56:41,080
lone Dr at least go even with kill

7457
04:56:41,080 --> 04:56:42,080
threat so I think it should be good

7458
04:56:42,080 --> 04:56:44,798
enough where did this hero go he was

7459
04:56:44,798 --> 04:56:47,080
pretty much top tier a couple of weeks

7460
04:56:47,080 --> 04:56:49,080
ago and we we barely seen him on the

7461
04:56:49,080 --> 04:56:50,480
main stage at all so what makes this a

7462
04:56:50,480 --> 04:56:52,600
good Beast Master game and the her got

7463
04:56:52,600 --> 04:56:54,120
some pretty significant Nerfs I think

7464
04:56:54,120 --> 04:56:55,798
the haulk especially level one is it

7465
04:56:55,798 --> 04:56:57,600
used to be completely op and now sort of

7466
04:56:57,600 --> 04:56:59,638
pathetic early um I think it's a really

7467
04:56:59,638 --> 04:57:00,920
good pick here though I think generally

7468
04:57:00,920 --> 04:57:02,320
when the like if you just look at

7469
04:57:02,320 --> 04:57:03,760
gliders lmes in general but also this

7470
04:57:03,760 --> 04:57:05,480
one a lot of times you can run out of

7471
04:57:05,480 --> 04:57:07,558
damage we've heard from the Quin Clips

7472
04:57:07,558 --> 04:57:08,680
like something they talk a lot about is

7473
04:57:08,680 --> 04:57:10,000
like keeping the formation and when you

7474
04:57:10,000 --> 04:57:12,160
play on that s the enemy tends to you

7475
04:57:12,160 --> 04:57:14,080
know you try to burst one guy they save

7476
04:57:14,080 --> 04:57:15,520
him and then you let run out of damage

7477
04:57:15,520 --> 04:57:17,240
you don't have enough to keep going but

7478
04:57:17,240 --> 04:57:18,440
Beast Master sort of like one of those

7479
04:57:18,440 --> 04:57:19,920
unlimited damage Heroes you can keep the

7480
04:57:19,920 --> 04:57:21,240
fight going keep throwing these axes

7481
04:57:21,240 --> 04:57:22,480
your damage keeps ramping up your

7482
04:57:22,480 --> 04:57:24,320
summoned is also like sort of a classic

7483
04:57:24,320 --> 04:57:26,440
counter to silencer just because if you

7484
04:57:26,440 --> 04:57:28,040
get to the levels on Beast Master sanser

7485
04:57:28,040 --> 04:57:28,958
doesn't really do anything to your

7486
04:57:28,958 --> 04:57:30,558
summons curse doesn't do much damage

7487
04:57:30,558 --> 04:57:33,200
it's too much mana and once you kick a

7488
04:57:33,200 --> 04:57:35,320
sort of weak laner like s Beast Master

7489
04:57:35,320 --> 04:57:36,480
it's one of the offers that really

7490
04:57:36,480 --> 04:57:39,480
snowball really hard take over the map I

7491
04:57:39,480 --> 04:57:41,080
think Willow one would Fenix be a good

7492
04:57:41,080 --> 04:57:42,480
ban here too I know silencer is good

7493
04:57:42,480 --> 04:57:44,440
versus Phoenix but I know ler hates

7494
04:57:44,440 --> 04:57:46,718
playing the ad hero and I think spirit's

7495
04:57:46,718 --> 04:57:48,160
looking for position four here as well

7496
04:57:48,160 --> 04:57:49,638
to Lane with that Beast Master most

7497
04:57:49,638 --> 04:57:51,878
likely do do you even feel like part of

7498
04:57:51,878 --> 04:57:55,000
the silencer pick here was a protection

7499
04:57:55,000 --> 04:57:56,440
pick so to speak against a potential

7500
04:57:56,440 --> 04:57:58,120
Phoenix coming out when they picked it

7501
04:57:58,120 --> 04:58:01,320
on gameing seconds remain hard to say

7502
04:58:01,320 --> 04:58:04,160
because like yeah you can silence them

7503
04:58:04,160 --> 04:58:06,600
but at the same time you could buy ways

7504
04:58:06,600 --> 04:58:07,878
to get out of it and you don't have a

7505
04:58:07,878 --> 04:58:09,360
good way to kill egg cuz Pango is just

7506
04:58:09,360 --> 04:58:11,240
rolling he can't attack lone Drew bear

7507
04:58:11,240 --> 04:58:13,440
is ineffective versus the egg Mor can

7508
04:58:13,440 --> 04:58:14,798
sort of do it but that's like going to

7509
04:58:14,798 --> 04:58:17,558
be your support most likely so team I

7510
04:58:17,558 --> 04:58:18,440
don't think they have enough but they're

7511
04:58:18,440 --> 04:58:19,920
going to leave it anyway so we'll see

7512
04:58:19,920 --> 04:58:22,040
what team spirit wants to pick up here

7513
04:58:22,040 --> 04:58:23,360
uh I feel like team spirit need a

7514
04:58:23,360 --> 04:58:25,480
partner for Puck to make some place on

7515
04:58:25,480 --> 04:58:27,280
the map because if Trent it's going to

7516
04:58:27,280 --> 04:58:28,680
be complicated and we will need

7517
04:58:28,680 --> 04:58:30,920
something to be happening for sure maybe

7518
04:58:30,920 --> 04:58:32,040
we don't need to do anything and

7519
04:58:32,040 --> 04:58:33,400
Gladiator is just going to run it them

7520
04:58:33,400 --> 04:58:35,920
and we're going to just skyra maybe I

7521
04:58:35,920 --> 04:58:37,480
can see Sky working I think the number

7522
04:58:37,480 --> 04:58:39,320
one party for team right now is making

7523
04:58:39,320 --> 04:58:41,160
sure the Beast Master is a good Lane if

7524
04:58:41,160 --> 04:58:42,520
Beast Master does not have a good Lane

7525
04:58:42,520 --> 04:58:44,000
against silencer then often times it can

7526
04:58:44,000 --> 04:58:45,760
be hard to fight into especially versus

7527
04:58:45,760 --> 04:58:47,638
pangle another match up where yes you

7528
04:58:47,638 --> 04:58:49,878
can roar his roll but if you cannot like

7529
04:58:49,878 --> 04:58:51,440
burst him in that then pangular becomes

7530
04:58:51,440 --> 04:58:52,558
very good against Beast Master in the

7531
04:58:52,558 --> 04:58:54,440
fights so I think the lane comes first

7532
04:58:54,440 --> 04:58:56,558
and then they can look at options after

7533
04:58:56,558 --> 04:58:59,280
that yeah for sure we aiming some good

7534
04:58:59,280 --> 04:59:00,680
carries against this master right now

7535
04:59:00,680 --> 04:59:04,440
too like with one terab and this looks

7536
04:59:04,440 --> 04:59:05,798
interesting I guess we'll see if the

7537
04:59:05,798 --> 04:59:07,638
Weaver will be on that position for or

7538
04:59:07,638 --> 04:59:08,718
not here if they're going to go for a

7539
04:59:08,718 --> 04:59:10,798
carry cuz that option does exist if they

7540
04:59:10,798 --> 04:59:12,440
want to go in I wouldn't mind a weaver

7541
04:59:12,440 --> 04:59:14,558
carry at all I think the lane would be

7542
04:59:14,558 --> 04:59:16,558
pretty strong for sanser Weaver doesn't

7543
04:59:16,558 --> 04:59:18,280
have to like commit I mean I think it

7544
04:59:18,280 --> 04:59:20,040
might depend what car they predicting

7545
04:59:20,040 --> 04:59:22,440
gladers to pick but I'm just not too

7546
04:59:22,440 --> 04:59:24,520
sure like what carry they're looking at

7547
04:59:24,520 --> 04:59:26,320
honestly in my head I'm like some drw

7548
04:59:26,320 --> 04:59:27,840
Ranger but that hero is not very strong

7549
04:59:27,840 --> 04:59:29,878
right now I just see yoro you know and

7550
04:59:29,878 --> 04:59:32,080
I'm like oh TI yoro drw Ranger it might

7551
04:59:32,080 --> 04:59:34,320
come

7552
04:59:34,760 --> 04:59:36,920
back nobody's been picking that hero

7553
04:59:36,920 --> 04:59:37,920
though right but it is a really good

7554
04:59:37,920 --> 04:59:40,480
game for it it's super good vers Pango

7555
04:59:40,480 --> 04:59:42,440
so annoying for L I feel like it's

7556
04:59:42,440 --> 04:59:44,400
probably not good enough of a hero but

7557
04:59:44,400 --> 04:59:45,718
if they would pick a new carry like I

7558
04:59:45,718 --> 04:59:46,718
want something like that with really

7559
04:59:46,718 --> 04:59:51,440
high damage oh to okay is this um I

7560
04:59:51,440 --> 04:59:52,400
think they're just punishing the

7561
04:59:52,400 --> 04:59:54,520
silencer right in the rning so on on

7562
04:59:54,520 --> 04:59:56,360
team spirit I think they've been playing

7563
04:59:56,360 --> 04:59:58,600
moska on the Tusk more so than mea if

7564
04:59:58,600 --> 05:00:00,280
I'm not mistaken is there a world that

7565
05:00:00,280 --> 05:00:01,958
this is a for Triant or do you think you

7566
05:00:01,958 --> 05:00:03,440
just have to put the Tusk for here with

7567
05:00:03,440 --> 05:00:05,160
Beast Master and how good is that lane

7568
05:00:05,160 --> 05:00:07,000
against what you're supposedly facing

7569
05:00:07,000 --> 05:00:08,680
here especially considering it's a blind

7570
05:00:08,680 --> 05:00:11,400
carry so far remain

7571
05:00:11,400 --> 05:00:13,360
I mean I wouldn't mind the tri four I

7572
05:00:13,360 --> 05:00:15,080
think like honestly committing really

7573
05:00:15,080 --> 05:00:17,000
hard into the Beast Master's Lane making

7574
05:00:17,000 --> 05:00:18,320
sure he secures it he can take over the

7575
05:00:18,320 --> 05:00:21,200
game is a good idea but I think dry

7576
05:00:21,200 --> 05:00:23,400
copter that's an old weaver really

7577
05:00:23,400 --> 05:00:25,600
really good for Beast Master too some

7578
05:00:25,600 --> 05:00:28,360
just die the Hulk is free golden exp

7579
05:00:28,360 --> 05:00:30,280
double melee versus double range that's

7580
05:00:30,280 --> 05:00:31,878
scary don't you guys just love when you

7581
05:00:31,878 --> 05:00:33,160
go into the finals and there's like

7582
05:00:33,160 --> 05:00:34,480
multiple Heroes that you haven't seen

7583
05:00:34,480 --> 05:00:36,240
for a week that come out in the very

7584
05:00:36,240 --> 05:00:38,760
first game amazing stuff so yeah beast

7585
05:00:38,760 --> 05:00:40,480
and Gyro

7586
05:00:40,480 --> 05:00:41,920
dare I say it's their first appearances

7587
05:00:41,920 --> 05:00:43,840
on the main stage I think so probably

7588
05:00:43,840 --> 05:00:45,480
haven't seen chyro on the main stage

7589
05:00:45,480 --> 05:00:46,958
since

7590
05:00:46,958 --> 05:00:49,718
ti5 he's back awesome uh what do you

7591
05:00:49,718 --> 05:00:51,718
guys make of this overall like if you do

7592
05:00:51,718 --> 05:00:52,840
you feel like there's any sort of

7593
05:00:52,840 --> 05:00:54,360
advantage that you can infer from

7594
05:00:54,360 --> 05:00:56,200
specific Lanes or you know what you've

7595
05:00:56,200 --> 05:00:57,200
seen from the team so far in the

7596
05:00:57,200 --> 05:00:58,480
tournament that makes you lean one way

7597
05:00:58,480 --> 05:00:59,840
or the other I think this game's going

7598
05:00:59,840 --> 05:01:01,440
to be completely decided in spirit safe

7599
05:01:01,440 --> 05:01:03,080
Lane like I think they picked this

7600
05:01:03,080 --> 05:01:05,600
Weaver and Trent just to be strong and L

7601
05:01:05,600 --> 05:01:07,120
is honestly sort of the same like this

7602
05:01:07,120 --> 05:01:08,920
hero really wants to win his Lane

7603
05:01:08,920 --> 05:01:10,600
depending on which way that lane goes I

7604
05:01:10,600 --> 05:01:12,160
think he'll determine a tempo for the

7605
05:01:12,160 --> 05:01:14,080
Post Lane phase I also feel the same

7606
05:01:14,080 --> 05:01:16,160
about gaming glader safe Lane as well if

7607
05:01:16,160 --> 05:01:17,760
it doesn't go well and Gyro doesn't have

7608
05:01:17,760 --> 05:01:19,400
a good laning stage and collapse can

7609
05:01:19,400 --> 05:01:21,440
manage to get kills with meor that could

7610
05:01:21,440 --> 05:01:23,280
change spirit's momentum a lot with this

7611
05:01:23,280 --> 05:01:26,040
Beast yeah very very depending on Lanes

7612
05:01:26,040 --> 05:01:28,160
right now how the lanes go will decide a

7613
05:01:28,160 --> 05:01:29,520
lot in this

7614
05:01:29,520 --> 05:01:31,600
game so how's the mid lane match up

7615
05:01:31,600 --> 05:01:34,160
going to go dendi uh to me it's may be a

7616
05:01:34,160 --> 05:01:36,400
little bit favorable for Pango but it's

7617
05:01:36,400 --> 05:01:38,798
still pretty good game for Puck but uh

7618
05:01:38,798 --> 05:01:40,280
it's pretty risky in my eyes to pick

7619
05:01:40,280 --> 05:01:42,200
buck so early like usually you want to

7620
05:01:42,200 --> 05:01:44,200
see more Heroes there is still two

7621
05:01:44,200 --> 05:01:46,200
silences so you want to buy a defensive

7622
05:01:46,200 --> 05:01:48,160
item which slows down other like

7623
05:01:48,160 --> 05:01:50,440
aggressive items that you might go for

7624
05:01:50,440 --> 05:01:53,440
so a bit scary for p yeah honestly I'm

7625
05:01:53,440 --> 05:01:54,760
really worried for a lot of this game I

7626
05:01:54,760 --> 05:01:56,520
feel like the gangs from tofu can come

7627
05:01:56,520 --> 05:01:58,080
in L is a hero you know he can just pull

7628
05:01:58,080 --> 05:01:59,400
away with his bear you can sort of leave

7629
05:01:59,400 --> 05:02:02,080
him alone and hopefully like that's why

7630
05:02:02,080 --> 05:02:03,718
I feel like if they don't win the yoro

7631
05:02:03,718 --> 05:02:05,480
MOs Lane it's going to like bleed really

7632
05:02:05,480 --> 05:02:07,520
hard into mid they can't keep the mort

7633
05:02:07,520 --> 05:02:10,000
there what do you guys make of the uh

7634
05:02:10,000 --> 05:02:11,920
the the Tusk here that Spirit ended up

7635
05:02:11,920 --> 05:02:13,638
going for into silencer who's

7636
05:02:13,638 --> 05:02:15,280
notoriously a really good anti- saave

7637
05:02:15,280 --> 05:02:16,718
hero and a big part of the Tusk is

7638
05:02:16,718 --> 05:02:18,200
saving allies with snowball do you think

7639
05:02:18,200 --> 05:02:19,958
that's maybe a little bit on the risky

7640
05:02:19,958 --> 05:02:21,638
side or I think he wants to kill the

7641
05:02:21,638 --> 05:02:23,680
silencer I think this is a hero that can

7642
05:02:23,680 --> 05:02:25,040
just like get on him and kill him right

7643
05:02:25,040 --> 05:02:26,280
away it's going to be more of aggressive

7644
05:02:26,280 --> 05:02:29,240
t Team instead of a defensive one yeah

7645
05:02:29,240 --> 05:02:30,520
for sure we're going to double jump with

7646
05:02:30,520 --> 05:02:32,240
Puck that's where going to be where

7647
05:02:32,240 --> 05:02:33,638
Target number

7648
05:02:33,638 --> 05:02:36,798
one all right thank you guys very much

7649
05:02:36,798 --> 05:02:38,680
with for your insights we are ready to

7650
05:02:38,680 --> 05:02:40,040
get into the game but before that that

7651
05:02:40,040 --> 05:02:41,718
we're going to a coach's interview with

7652
05:02:41,718 --> 05:02:44,240
silent from team spirit thank you very

7653
05:02:44,240 --> 05:02:46,440
much yes I am joined by silent of team

7654
05:02:46,440 --> 05:02:48,000
spirit as we get ready for this Grand

7655
05:02:48,000 --> 05:02:50,840
Final a best of five grand final not

7656
05:02:50,840 --> 05:02:52,400
many teams get the privilege of playing

7657
05:02:52,400 --> 05:02:54,520
best of fives but you've been to many of

7658
05:02:54,520 --> 05:02:56,320
them so to you is there any difference

7659
05:02:56,320 --> 05:02:58,480
between best of three DOTA versus best

7660
05:02:58,480 --> 05:03:01,320
of five DOTA uh for me you have uh more

7661
05:03:01,320 --> 05:03:04,120
chances to do a mistake best of three

7662
05:03:04,120 --> 05:03:06,120
you can really don't figure out how to

7663
05:03:06,120 --> 05:03:08,600
play against your enemy and what might

7664
05:03:08,600 --> 05:03:10,600
cost you serious

7665
05:03:10,600 --> 05:03:13,520
uh but here uh lucky it's best uh best

7666
05:03:13,520 --> 05:03:17,638
of five because uh Gladiators have

7667
05:03:17,638 --> 05:03:20,520
some we we play way too fast and I think

7668
05:03:20,520 --> 05:03:24,200
we need to adapt somehow for that uh

7669
05:03:24,200 --> 05:03:26,400
that's the point all right well we got

7670
05:03:26,400 --> 05:03:29,240
to get that data with a game number one

7671
05:03:29,240 --> 05:03:33,798
so Seattle are you ready to start Grand

7672
05:03:34,240 --> 05:03:37,200
finals that's what I like to hear let's

7673
05:03:37,200 --> 05:03:40,558
get into it with game number one

7674
05:03:40,558 --> 05:03:43,000
that's right it's time to make our grand

7675
05:03:43,000 --> 05:03:45,878
finals head underway on one side we have

7676
05:03:45,878 --> 05:03:48,760
a team that is absolutely the best team

7677
05:03:48,760 --> 05:03:50,878
of the year but on the other side the

7678
05:03:50,878 --> 05:03:52,760
strongest team of the tournament on one

7679
05:03:52,760 --> 05:03:55,240
side we have three time te major winners

7680
05:03:55,240 --> 05:03:57,718
and on the other side TI winners but

7681
05:03:57,718 --> 05:04:00,920
only one can claim the ages I've seen a

7682
05:04:00,920 --> 05:04:03,480
lot of TI cap we are going back 12

7683
05:04:03,480 --> 05:04:05,280
editions of this right now we have seen

7684
05:04:05,280 --> 05:04:06,718
lower bracket runs we've seen upper

7685
05:04:06,718 --> 05:04:08,798
bracket runs we have seen first Bloods

7686
05:04:08,798 --> 05:04:10,558
we have seen Roshan but one thing is

7687
05:04:10,558 --> 05:04:13,080
absolutely clear to me right now at ti2

7688
05:04:13,080 --> 05:04:14,718
in the heart of DOTA and Seattle these

7689
05:04:14,718 --> 05:04:17,080
two teams are undoubtedly the best two

7690
05:04:17,080 --> 05:04:19,200
teams in the world right now and both of

7691
05:04:19,200 --> 05:04:21,440
them are absolutely terrifying and

7692
05:04:21,440 --> 05:04:24,000
that's exactly why gaming Gladiators

7693
05:04:24,000 --> 05:04:25,760
stack the Bounty runes but they failed

7694
05:04:25,760 --> 05:04:28,000
to be able to claim the first blood they

7695
05:04:28,000 --> 05:04:29,558
wanted to be able to get that early

7696
05:04:29,558 --> 05:04:33,480
momentum over a team that is so scary I

7697
05:04:33,480 --> 05:04:36,160
mean team spirit have demolished every

7698
05:04:36,160 --> 05:04:38,480
team that has stood in their way gaming

7699
05:04:38,480 --> 05:04:40,400
Gladiators though have had to make the

7700
05:04:40,400 --> 05:04:42,320
long run through the lower bracket and

7701
05:04:42,320 --> 05:04:43,840
there's something special about that

7702
05:04:43,840 --> 05:04:45,638
lower bracket momentum you cannot

7703
05:04:45,638 --> 05:04:47,120
underestimate how much this team has

7704
05:04:47,120 --> 05:04:49,080
gone through especially going to their

7705
05:04:49,080 --> 05:04:51,680
fourth valavan Grand final of the year

7706
05:04:51,680 --> 05:04:53,558
no team has made a complete sweep and

7707
05:04:53,558 --> 05:04:55,200
usually the team that is favored in that

7708
05:04:55,200 --> 05:04:57,200
sense can't even make that type of run

7709
05:04:57,200 --> 05:04:59,760
so this team cannot be underestimated at

7710
05:04:59,760 --> 05:05:02,280
the same time all of us here watching

7711
05:05:02,280 --> 05:05:03,840
when you see a Toro come out of that

7712
05:05:03,840 --> 05:05:07,000
player walkway with a shaved head the

7713
05:05:07,000 --> 05:05:08,520
amount of fear that instills into you

7714
05:05:08,520 --> 05:05:09,840
the amount this man is willing to

7715
05:05:09,840 --> 05:05:11,878
sacrifice to claim a second agis and

7716
05:05:11,878 --> 05:05:14,400
join that limited Pantheon of two time

7717
05:05:14,400 --> 05:05:15,760
TI

7718
05:05:15,760 --> 05:05:18,120
winners you can't not help but be a

7719
05:05:18,120 --> 05:05:19,958
little afraid of what he's willing to do

7720
05:05:19,958 --> 05:05:21,520
here in a best of five both these teams

7721
05:05:21,520 --> 05:05:23,240
are capable of anything the greatest

7722
05:05:23,240 --> 05:05:24,760
question however if you watch the lower

7723
05:05:24,760 --> 05:05:26,718
bracket run from gaming is can team

7724
05:05:26,718 --> 05:05:28,840
spirit put a stop to the speed and the

7725
05:05:28,840 --> 05:05:30,320
tempo in which they are playing these

7726
05:05:30,320 --> 05:05:32,920
games cuz right now nobody across all of

7727
05:05:32,920 --> 05:05:34,638
those Series has been able to do it how

7728
05:05:34,638 --> 05:05:36,080
a lot of these games have not gone past

7729
05:05:36,080 --> 05:05:38,600
the 25-minute mark so you need to slow

7730
05:05:38,600 --> 05:05:40,160
it down you need to play your game or at

7731
05:05:40,160 --> 05:05:42,120
least take it back to them if there is

7732
05:05:42,120 --> 05:05:43,040
one team in the world that can

7733
05:05:43,040 --> 05:05:44,878
accomplish that it is team spirit who

7734
05:05:44,878 --> 05:05:46,638
have shown that they are no slouches

7735
05:05:46,638 --> 05:05:47,958
when it comes to the first 10 minutes

7736
05:05:47,958 --> 05:05:50,000
particularly the laning phase yes this

7737
05:05:50,000 --> 05:05:51,400
laning phase is going to be the ultimate

7738
05:05:51,400 --> 05:05:52,920
test for this best of five it's going to

7739
05:05:52,920 --> 05:05:54,600
be a long journey to get through this

7740
05:05:54,600 --> 05:05:56,718
finals and who walks away winning this

7741
05:05:56,718 --> 05:05:58,480
laning phase could just end up winning

7742
05:05:58,480 --> 05:06:00,718
the entire thing as moska will end up

7743
05:06:00,718 --> 05:06:03,240
going down kofu finally claims first

7744
05:06:03,240 --> 05:06:05,120
blood for gaming Gladiator and this is a

7745
05:06:05,120 --> 05:06:07,160
familiar story acceleration for Ace on

7746
05:06:07,160 --> 05:06:08,958
the off Lane lone Drew this is a hero

7747
05:06:08,958 --> 05:06:10,798
that has demolish the lower bracket

7748
05:06:10,798 --> 05:06:12,958
along with all the buildings in those

7749
05:06:12,958 --> 05:06:15,520
series a scary hero to give a lead off

7750
05:06:15,520 --> 05:06:17,558
to here especially when once more gam

7751
05:06:17,558 --> 05:06:18,878
have a lot of tempo that can just go

7752
05:06:18,878 --> 05:06:20,760
with Ace go through these objectives

7753
05:06:20,760 --> 05:06:23,200
play with that Bear's timings but I like

7754
05:06:23,200 --> 05:06:24,200
what Spirit have brought out here in

7755
05:06:24,200 --> 05:06:25,718
game one right these are a lot of Heroes

7756
05:06:25,718 --> 05:06:27,120
that are not afraid to Skirmish early

7757
05:06:27,120 --> 05:06:29,600
and straight back death against tofu

7758
05:06:29,600 --> 05:06:32,798
will end up helping to get the kill on

7759
05:06:32,798 --> 05:06:35,638
to tofu but will end up falling in the

7760
05:06:35,638 --> 05:06:37,878
end Ace is gladly going to be able to

7761
05:06:37,878 --> 05:06:40,280
dive a bit more onto moska they are

7762
05:06:40,280 --> 05:06:41,600
definitely winning this Lane they're

7763
05:06:41,600 --> 05:06:43,040
walking away with it a bit and that's

7764
05:06:43,040 --> 05:06:44,320
going to be fast over corrosion for the

7765
05:06:44,320 --> 05:06:45,400
faar that's going to give them a lot of

7766
05:06:45,400 --> 05:06:47,240
Chase down potential on this Lane

7767
05:06:47,240 --> 05:06:50,320
aska oh he has that extra little bit of

7768
05:06:50,320 --> 05:06:52,040
heal end up dying the bear that's going

7769
05:06:52,040 --> 05:06:53,840
to be three out gold over to utoro but

7770
05:06:53,840 --> 05:06:55,680
AIDS can keep up that pressure with a

7771
05:06:55,680 --> 05:06:58,240
fresh reub big turnaround for yoro

7772
05:06:58,240 --> 05:06:59,840
honestly this Lane was looking a little

7773
05:06:59,840 --> 05:07:01,958
grm if you get Ace to that fast over

7774
05:07:01,958 --> 05:07:03,160
corrosion which has just taken over a

7775
05:07:03,160 --> 05:07:04,040
lot of these Lanes all of a sudden you

7776
05:07:04,040 --> 05:07:06,080
get a bear kill back lot of golden XP

7777
05:07:06,080 --> 05:07:07,718
for yoro he can start the regain

7778
05:07:07,718 --> 05:07:09,040
momentum in this Lane this is a very

7779
05:07:09,040 --> 05:07:10,360
strong Lane for for team spirit tree

7780
05:07:10,360 --> 05:07:12,638
Weaver there's not much that beats us so

7781
05:07:12,638 --> 05:07:14,638
this just shows how strong this offing

7782
05:07:14,638 --> 05:07:17,200
is for gaming as well they're com a

7783
05:07:17,200 --> 05:07:18,480
massive win if they could actually bring

7784
05:07:18,480 --> 05:07:19,958
down Ace but yoro is going to have to

7785
05:07:19,958 --> 05:07:22,000
try and go for tofu instead who gave up

7786
05:07:22,000 --> 05:07:23,440
his own life to be able to kill the bug

7787
05:07:23,440 --> 05:07:26,958
on Ace to protect his core he do die but

7788
05:07:26,958 --> 05:07:28,878
if utoro gets caught by an entangle here

7789
05:07:28,878 --> 05:07:30,958
it's going to be a heavy punish But Not

7790
05:07:30,958 --> 05:07:32,958
Afraid turns around battles back against

7791
05:07:32,958 --> 05:07:35,240
that be knowing Ace still has some time

7792
05:07:35,240 --> 05:07:37,360
before he has another resummon available

7793
05:07:37,360 --> 05:07:39,160
still a lot of gold going to yoro here

7794
05:07:39,160 --> 05:07:41,360
as he takes a net worth lead good sign

7795
05:07:41,360 --> 05:07:43,080
for team spirit is I mean Weaver has to

7796
05:07:43,080 --> 05:07:44,200
be one of the fastest carries in this

7797
05:07:44,200 --> 05:07:45,718
met I think CK is the other one that I

7798
05:07:45,718 --> 05:07:47,878
had point to of course brisac he's a

7799
05:07:47,878 --> 05:07:50,200
pseudo carry getting banned out this is

7800
05:07:50,200 --> 05:07:52,040
a hero that team spirit first pick for a

7801
05:07:52,040 --> 05:07:53,440
reason if they get him to a good

7802
05:07:53,440 --> 05:07:54,958
position he can go and defend all these

7803
05:07:54,958 --> 05:07:56,440
towers you can take every single fight

7804
05:07:56,440 --> 05:07:58,920
with this carry hero try and match Dao's

7805
05:07:58,920 --> 05:08:00,798
Pace where I almost feel like it doesn't

7806
05:08:00,798 --> 05:08:02,600
matter what hero Dao's playing this guy

7807
05:08:02,600 --> 05:08:03,718
is going to run at you he's going to

7808
05:08:03,718 --> 05:08:05,240
join all the skirmishes with Quinn you

7809
05:08:05,240 --> 05:08:07,200
have to be ready for the fan collapse at

7810
05:08:07,200 --> 05:08:09,718
a certain point either get get some

7811
05:08:09,718 --> 05:08:11,120
trades be ready to defend them at the

7812
05:08:11,120 --> 05:08:12,718
towers this Beast Master can trade on

7813
05:08:12,718 --> 05:08:14,680
the map that's another objective that

7814
05:08:14,680 --> 05:08:16,240
team spirit can look for as this game

7815
05:08:16,240 --> 05:08:18,400
progresses I feel like out of all the

7816
05:08:18,400 --> 05:08:20,120
players on gameing Gladiators it's

7817
05:08:20,120 --> 05:08:22,360
definitely dorio that's a resummon yeah

7818
05:08:22,360 --> 05:08:25,280
it is Ace he'll lose yet another bear

7819
05:08:25,280 --> 05:08:27,160
yoro is just climbing up the network

7820
05:08:27,160 --> 05:08:29,878
chart now a laning face that started off

7821
05:08:29,878 --> 05:08:32,000
a bit bad for them but now they've got a

7822
05:08:32,000 --> 05:08:34,080
full 20 second window with no bear so

7823
05:08:34,080 --> 05:08:35,480
they should easily be able to get most

7824
05:08:35,480 --> 05:08:38,920
of the Cs and also the the Bounty man he

7825
05:08:38,920 --> 05:08:41,760
is sitting at 3K net worth already way

7826
05:08:41,760 --> 05:08:43,480
ahead of anybody else in this game it

7827
05:08:43,480 --> 05:08:44,920
adds up real fast these bears are worth

7828
05:08:44,920 --> 05:08:46,760
a lot it's also extra damage going into

7829
05:08:46,760 --> 05:08:48,080
Ace you're not healing while the faar is

7830
05:08:48,080 --> 05:08:50,040
on cool down there's a lot going wrong

7831
05:08:50,040 --> 05:08:51,440
in this off lane for gaming right now

7832
05:08:51,440 --> 05:08:52,558
for the hero that's supposed to give

7833
05:08:52,558 --> 05:08:54,440
them that lead at least comparatively to

7834
05:08:54,440 --> 05:08:55,840
those other games right this is still a

7835
05:08:55,840 --> 05:08:57,920
very even game but if you watched any of

7836
05:08:57,920 --> 05:08:59,240
these Series yesterday particularly the

7837
05:08:59,240 --> 05:09:02,120
azer one I guess you're not down 5K at

7838
05:09:02,120 --> 05:09:03,520
the 5 minute Mark you're doing pretty

7839
05:09:03,520 --> 05:09:05,360
well yeah seriously you cannot let

7840
05:09:05,360 --> 05:09:06,760
gaming Gladiators run away with the

7841
05:09:06,760 --> 05:09:08,480
laning ph and that when we were talking

7842
05:09:08,480 --> 05:09:10,240
about a backstage and so many else so

7843
05:09:10,240 --> 05:09:11,600
many other people that we talked to

7844
05:09:11,600 --> 05:09:14,000
Backstage everybody was saying team

7845
05:09:14,000 --> 05:09:15,520
spirit is not going to get run over the

7846
05:09:15,520 --> 05:09:17,440
landing won't let that happen you can

7847
05:09:17,440 --> 05:09:19,360
make these kind of rotations pick up on

7848
05:09:19,360 --> 05:09:20,840
the snowball they have three Heroes to

7849
05:09:20,840 --> 05:09:22,558
all bang onto this jar copter but it's

7850
05:09:22,558 --> 05:09:24,558
not quite good enough tofu protecting

7851
05:09:24,558 --> 05:09:27,000
them nicely they'll get some damage in

7852
05:09:27,000 --> 05:09:29,120
return but team spirit are going to

7853
05:09:29,120 --> 05:09:31,440
remain relatively healthy nice missile

7854
05:09:31,440 --> 05:09:33,040
Dodge on the snowball mea he's going to

7855
05:09:33,040 --> 05:09:34,240
be able to make some really nice plays

7856
05:09:34,240 --> 05:09:35,600
this game this Tusk is a hero that can

7857
05:09:35,600 --> 05:09:37,320
not only give him the physical burst to

7858
05:09:37,320 --> 05:09:38,958
go through the bear at the later stages

7859
05:09:38,958 --> 05:09:40,680
but the snowball Dodge on Heroes like

7860
05:09:40,680 --> 05:09:42,080
gyro and pangle have to throw out their

7861
05:09:42,080 --> 05:09:43,718
Spells at the start of the fight it can

7862
05:09:43,718 --> 05:09:45,600
get you your core bkbs off it can stall

7863
05:09:45,600 --> 05:09:47,520
out the fight get you a roar off of you

7864
05:09:47,520 --> 05:09:49,240
know collapse coming back out of it

7865
05:09:49,240 --> 05:09:50,080
something that could be really

7866
05:09:50,080 --> 05:09:51,840
instrumental as this game progresses

7867
05:09:51,840 --> 05:09:53,600
here and once more Spirit making the

7868
05:09:53,600 --> 05:09:55,558
first moov poka has been really active

7869
05:09:55,558 --> 05:09:57,440
in this laning phase trying to skew it

7870
05:09:57,440 --> 05:09:59,360
as much as possible to team spirit's

7871
05:09:59,360 --> 05:10:01,320
Advantage give them that breathing room

7872
05:10:01,320 --> 05:10:02,400
and of course this is a tri and

7873
05:10:02,400 --> 05:10:03,638
protector lineup we're talking about

7874
05:10:03,638 --> 05:10:05,320
these objectives something Gaming's

7875
05:10:05,320 --> 05:10:07,240
focused on you can keep your Towers up

7876
05:10:07,240 --> 05:10:08,920
Living Armor it double blows are going

7877
05:10:08,920 --> 05:10:10,080
to help here and Quinn's going to come

7878
05:10:10,080 --> 05:10:11,638
back into this place se's an opportunity

7879
05:10:11,638 --> 05:10:13,520
but Z is the two supports are already

7880
05:10:13,520 --> 05:10:15,840
dead though and there's no way for this

7881
05:10:15,840 --> 05:10:18,120
Puck to change the match up now plus two

7882
05:10:18,120 --> 05:10:20,400
in on the board for celery glaes already

7883
05:10:20,400 --> 05:10:22,600
getting some extra work done will leave

7884
05:10:22,600 --> 05:10:24,440
solo Lanes on these side so yoro going

7885
05:10:24,440 --> 05:10:26,558
to try and make the most of it he gets

7886
05:10:26,558 --> 05:10:28,600
rooted oh you know he wanted another

7887
05:10:28,600 --> 05:10:30,040
bear kill on this Lane man he has been

7888
05:10:30,040 --> 05:10:31,718
taken it to Ace level Advantage already

7889
05:10:31,718 --> 05:10:34,440
going y Toro's way it look like it'll

7890
05:10:34,440 --> 05:10:36,240
just be the Dragon Land so defensive

7891
05:10:36,240 --> 05:10:38,120
oriented build here from the Toro get

7892
05:10:38,120 --> 05:10:40,718
the high HP up don't get bursted in this

7893
05:10:40,718 --> 05:10:43,280
game man he is just chunking haste down

7894
05:10:43,280 --> 05:10:45,638
this is Rome opportunity up here right

7895
05:10:45,638 --> 05:10:47,040
like this is a Great Hero for team

7896
05:10:47,040 --> 05:10:48,878
spirit the Roman you can keep chipping

7897
05:10:48,878 --> 05:10:50,840
Ace's HP pool cuz every time you kill

7898
05:10:50,840 --> 05:10:52,160
this bear he has to resummon he's

7899
05:10:52,160 --> 05:10:53,680
susceptible again and you don't really

7900
05:10:53,680 --> 05:10:56,040
take the ult too early Laur he's going

7901
05:10:56,040 --> 05:10:57,920
to try and bait it out here by using the

7902
05:10:57,920 --> 05:10:59,360
illusion Rune the first Power Rune was

7903
05:10:59,360 --> 05:11:01,200
an illusion Rune not necessarily one

7904
05:11:01,200 --> 05:11:02,400
that you feel the best about but he's

7905
05:11:02,400 --> 05:11:03,680
going to try and bait It Out by showing

7906
05:11:03,680 --> 05:11:05,000
his illusion mid and seeing if they can

7907
05:11:05,000 --> 05:11:07,120
catch something in this Top Lane tofu

7908
05:11:07,120 --> 05:11:08,520
he's going to be marked there couldn't

7909
05:11:08,520 --> 05:11:09,958
get there in time to snag away the

7910
05:11:09,958 --> 05:11:11,840
wisdom Rune but they can get this one

7911
05:11:11,840 --> 05:11:15,638
kill Ace is around laurl he'll back away

7912
05:11:15,638 --> 05:11:17,160
so will Ace he's ready for the push

7913
05:11:17,160 --> 05:11:18,520
that's coming in in fact he knows he's

7914
05:11:18,520 --> 05:11:19,798
kind of surrounded by Heroes so he wants

7915
05:11:19,798 --> 05:11:22,360
to play defensively but LL already back

7916
05:11:22,360 --> 05:11:23,680
to the mid lane doesn't want to miss out

7917
05:11:23,680 --> 05:11:25,680
on too much of his CS nice heads up

7918
05:11:25,680 --> 05:11:27,360
smoke by Spirit uh they are a team that

7919
05:11:27,360 --> 05:11:28,760
will happily smoke to any of these

7920
05:11:28,760 --> 05:11:30,440
wisdom runes and if you studied them you

7921
05:11:30,440 --> 05:11:32,840
know it's coming the seven the 14 the 21

7922
05:11:32,840 --> 05:11:34,360
especially is one of their big power

7923
05:11:34,360 --> 05:11:36,600
moves they really want this XP advantage

7924
05:11:36,600 --> 05:11:38,360
and again rotating to Ace's Lane I think

7925
05:11:38,360 --> 05:11:40,040
is a ree for success the other move

7926
05:11:40,040 --> 05:11:41,320
you're going to make is to collapse when

7927
05:11:41,320 --> 05:11:42,600
that Helm is up to try and push this

7928
05:11:42,600 --> 05:11:43,840
Tower or kick to watch you out of the

7929
05:11:43,840 --> 05:11:45,798
lane but I feel like every time you make

7930
05:11:45,798 --> 05:11:47,240
one of these aggressive moves on gaming

7931
05:11:47,240 --> 05:11:49,160
in the early game you're pretty happy

7932
05:11:49,160 --> 05:11:50,240
with it right cuz it means they're not

7933
05:11:50,240 --> 05:11:51,440
going to ace they're not pushing your

7934
05:11:51,440 --> 05:11:52,638
Tower and then things like this can

7935
05:11:52,638 --> 05:11:55,080
start to happen where another kill for

7936
05:11:55,080 --> 05:11:57,680
yoro he is absolutely out of control oh

7937
05:11:57,680 --> 05:11:58,920
and there car's going to be in trouble

7938
05:11:58,920 --> 05:12:01,320
as well p is in big trouble here on the

7939
05:12:01,320 --> 05:12:03,040
side of gaming Gladiators and no TP

7940
05:12:03,040 --> 05:12:04,718
rotation coming in so they're just going

7941
05:12:04,718 --> 05:12:07,200
to run down Daio do they dive the tower

7942
05:12:07,200 --> 05:12:08,680
though it's a bit scary and they've run

7943
05:12:08,680 --> 05:12:11,080
out of Reon ources so drau lives but

7944
05:12:11,080 --> 05:12:12,760
only on the sliver of HP and it's not

7945
05:12:12,760 --> 05:12:14,440
doing him much good either cuz he's

7946
05:12:14,440 --> 05:12:15,958
going to have to make a run back to the

7947
05:12:15,958 --> 05:12:17,878
Fountain very likely you can see the

7948
05:12:17,878 --> 05:12:20,000
sidelane pressure here this is another

7949
05:12:20,000 --> 05:12:21,440
thing that's causing gam some issues

7950
05:12:21,440 --> 05:12:22,558
right now because they want to rotate

7951
05:12:22,558 --> 05:12:24,520
towards mid play around Quinn so every

7952
05:12:24,520 --> 05:12:25,920
time you bring supports off the side

7953
05:12:25,920 --> 05:12:27,520
Lanes it's up to Spirit to recreate the

7954
05:12:27,520 --> 05:12:28,718
pressure there and not let Quinn get

7955
05:12:28,718 --> 05:12:29,798
away with these skirmishes with the

7956
05:12:29,798 --> 05:12:31,638
power runes however gaming rotating

7957
05:12:31,638 --> 05:12:33,440
supports mid will secure that power room

7958
05:12:33,440 --> 05:12:35,160
for Quinn now it's a question of what he

7959
05:12:35,160 --> 05:12:37,000
can do with it here I mean can you

7960
05:12:37,000 --> 05:12:38,718
rotate into y tor's lane is this Weaver

7961
05:12:38,718 --> 05:12:40,958
killable in the very early game calling

7962
05:12:40,958 --> 05:12:42,798
plus some Roots it's

7963
05:12:42,798 --> 05:12:44,718
doable and in fact they're just going to

7964
05:12:44,718 --> 05:12:46,320
bring everybody up here try and go on

7965
05:12:46,320 --> 05:12:47,920
Ace again this is one the lone Drew is

7966
05:12:47,920 --> 05:12:50,000
susceptible perfect opportunity with the

7967
05:12:50,000 --> 05:12:52,040
bear now being put on cool down they

7968
05:12:52,040 --> 05:12:54,440
have done serious damage to Ace killing

7969
05:12:54,440 --> 05:12:56,200
him so many times and even maybe

7970
05:12:56,200 --> 05:12:58,000
catching tofu here C is going to try and

7971
05:12:58,000 --> 05:12:59,798
slow him down but that's two supports

7972
05:12:59,798 --> 05:13:01,878
without a real stun they're just going

7973
05:13:01,878 --> 05:13:04,000
to back away though bottom Lane that was

7974
05:13:04,000 --> 05:13:06,600
the rotation coming out from Quinn mea

7975
05:13:06,600 --> 05:13:08,320
left a bit alone here as the Beast

7976
05:13:08,320 --> 05:13:10,200
Master went for the Lotus instead good

7977
05:13:10,200 --> 05:13:12,280
separation there with Shard and Quinn

7978
05:13:12,280 --> 05:13:14,280
doesn't feel like diving too deep and

7979
05:13:14,280 --> 05:13:16,000
this is the helm coming out finished for

7980
05:13:16,000 --> 05:13:17,480
collapse so now you have a second

7981
05:13:17,480 --> 05:13:18,840
pressure point of the map if your team

7982
05:13:18,840 --> 05:13:20,240
spirit you've got through this early

7983
05:13:20,240 --> 05:13:22,440
game in a pretty decent spot yoro well

7984
05:13:22,440 --> 05:13:24,240
ahead of the pack so if he wants to

7985
05:13:24,240 --> 05:13:26,000
rotate play with collapse start pushing

7986
05:13:26,000 --> 05:13:27,160
some of these towers you can start to

7987
05:13:27,160 --> 05:13:29,718
take Gaming's game plan against them

7988
05:13:29,718 --> 05:13:31,878
here as they are still struggling to

7989
05:13:31,878 --> 05:13:33,958
keep Ace in that offlane this bear has

7990
05:13:33,958 --> 05:13:36,080
just been exploited in the early game so

7991
05:13:36,080 --> 05:13:39,840
much extra golden XP

7992
05:13:40,040 --> 05:13:42,680
gets back to the safety of the trees

7993
05:13:42,680 --> 05:13:47,080
gaming Gladiators are here in force but

7994
05:13:47,080 --> 05:13:48,480
fortunately the Pango versus the Beast

7995
05:13:48,480 --> 05:13:50,040
Masters doesn't necessarily leave you

7996
05:13:50,040 --> 05:13:52,400
the most options can't really put to use

7997
05:13:52,400 --> 05:13:53,600
that Rolling Thunder super well he's

7998
05:13:53,600 --> 05:13:55,040
going to try for it anyway perhaps going

7999
05:13:55,040 --> 05:13:56,680
to force out the par La Roar collapse

8000
05:13:56,680 --> 05:13:57,840
now going to try and back away with that

8001
05:13:57,840 --> 05:14:00,000
extra bit of movement speed does get hit

8002
05:14:00,000 --> 05:14:01,240
by the jar copter ultimate that's going

8003
05:14:01,240 --> 05:14:02,638
to slow him down enough good snowball

8004
05:14:02,638 --> 05:14:05,160
pickup from meor that buys him a couple

8005
05:14:05,160 --> 05:14:06,440
seconds but Quinn is going to follow

8006
05:14:06,440 --> 05:14:08,680
that ball he is perfectly be able to hit

8007
05:14:08,680 --> 05:14:10,878
him both wasb it enough though and Daio

8008
05:14:10,878 --> 05:14:12,558
and Quinn are now in trouble top of the

8009
05:14:12,558 --> 05:14:14,638
coil Laurel going to lock him down and

8010
05:14:14,638 --> 05:14:16,120
there's not much these supports can do

8011
05:14:16,120 --> 05:14:17,558
to stop it in fact they're just going to

8012
05:14:17,558 --> 05:14:19,200
feed right alongside the other two of

8013
05:14:19,200 --> 05:14:21,520
gaming Gladiators as team spirit in a

8014
05:14:21,520 --> 05:14:23,600
fiveman move sweep over gaming

8015
05:14:23,600 --> 05:14:25,360
Gladiators run them down underneath

8016
05:14:25,360 --> 05:14:27,520
their towers and even through the portal

8017
05:14:27,520 --> 05:14:31,040
kku will be denied that exit instead

8018
05:14:31,040 --> 05:14:33,480
he'll head back to the Fountain after a

8019
05:14:33,480 --> 05:14:36,360
triple kill for yoro and yoro straight

8020
05:14:36,360 --> 05:14:38,600
back to the Top Lane doesn't miss a beat

8021
05:14:38,600 --> 05:14:40,760
the down side of all that off lane going

8022
05:14:40,760 --> 05:14:42,000
wrong for Game and his Ace didn't even

8023
05:14:42,000 --> 05:14:43,440
have a bear during all that so you

8024
05:14:43,440 --> 05:14:45,440
cannot bring the numbers to that fight

8025
05:14:45,440 --> 05:14:47,400
just an overextension on collapse that

8026
05:14:47,400 --> 05:14:49,280
yoro is happy to join and get the big

8027
05:14:49,280 --> 05:14:52,240
swarm turnaround kill of course with a

8028
05:14:52,240 --> 05:14:54,520
beautiful coil just lock him in place

8029
05:14:54,520 --> 05:14:56,160
let the Weaver do the damage here this

8030
05:14:56,160 --> 05:14:59,958
is very deep it feels like a for yeah

8031
05:14:59,958 --> 05:15:02,520
forc play if anything right and you know

8032
05:15:02,520 --> 05:15:03,840
the snowball save is going to come out

8033
05:15:03,840 --> 05:15:04,958
here this is what I'm saying you

8034
05:15:04,958 --> 05:15:06,520
disjoint the missile you disjoint some

8035
05:15:06,520 --> 05:15:08,600
of the gyro damage that turnaround is

8036
05:15:08,600 --> 05:15:10,120
deadly tri's going to give you sustain

8037
05:15:10,120 --> 05:15:11,840
to just push through a lot of this poke

8038
05:15:11,840 --> 05:15:14,878
damage you're also missing the supportal

8039
05:15:14,878 --> 05:15:17,000
like w and silence are not too strong

8040
05:15:17,000 --> 05:15:18,600
when they don't got the silence on him

8041
05:15:18,600 --> 05:15:19,840
if they can keep him in place the dead

8042
05:15:19,840 --> 05:15:21,200
shot moves him back in they have to use

8043
05:15:21,200 --> 05:15:23,798
the global but it will get the job done

8044
05:15:23,798 --> 05:15:27,200
a huge kill streak going the way of Ace

8045
05:15:27,200 --> 05:15:29,400
his Networth just shot right back up as

8046
05:15:29,400 --> 05:15:32,200
he got 587 gold for just himself off

8047
05:15:32,200 --> 05:15:33,680
that kill I mean we're 11 minutes in the

8048
05:15:33,680 --> 05:15:36,878
game and yor already had a 6X streak so

8049
05:15:36,878 --> 05:15:38,558
Ace absolutely happy to pick that up

8050
05:15:38,558 --> 05:15:40,320
that's the the global vers the Weaver

8051
05:15:40,320 --> 05:15:41,920
before he has any sort of dispel item

8052
05:15:41,920 --> 05:15:43,360
which looks like it's going to become

8053
05:15:43,360 --> 05:15:45,240
very late in this game as yoro opted for

8054
05:15:45,240 --> 05:15:47,080
a deso buildup another reason that kill

8055
05:15:47,080 --> 05:15:48,798
was pretty valuable right you slow down

8056
05:15:48,798 --> 05:15:50,320
the death so limit the charges he get in

8057
05:15:50,320 --> 05:15:52,320
these early exchanges the slower it is

8058
05:15:52,320 --> 05:15:54,638
the worst it's going to be cuz his pace

8059
05:15:54,638 --> 05:15:58,480
is very strong right now of course Daio

8060
05:15:58,480 --> 05:15:59,958
we have not seen gyro too much to this

8061
05:15:59,958 --> 05:16:01,680
tournament but the big upside for this

8062
05:16:01,680 --> 05:16:03,480
hero is the stacking right it's not

8063
05:16:03,480 --> 05:16:04,878
something we've seen gaming go back to a

8064
05:16:04,878 --> 05:16:06,760
lot as the games been very fast but this

8065
05:16:06,760 --> 05:16:08,440
triangle is getting stacked and is

8066
05:16:08,440 --> 05:16:10,480
waiting for gyro to come and collect the

8067
05:16:10,480 --> 05:16:12,440
other ancients are also doubled up right

8068
05:16:12,440 --> 05:16:14,760
now so this is a lot of golden XP

8069
05:16:14,760 --> 05:16:16,360
sitting in the bank for gam if they can

8070
05:16:16,360 --> 05:16:17,878
move Dau over there start to clear

8071
05:16:17,878 --> 05:16:19,798
through with the max FL Cannon something

8072
05:16:19,798 --> 05:16:20,920
that team spirit might think about

8073
05:16:20,920 --> 05:16:22,280
contesting depending on how fast they

8074
05:16:22,280 --> 05:16:24,080
can push these towers down yeah

8075
05:16:24,080 --> 05:16:25,840
absolutely I think that that in this

8076
05:16:25,840 --> 05:16:27,958
game it's funny but I feel like the game

8077
05:16:27,958 --> 05:16:29,600
plan is kind of swamped where team

8078
05:16:29,600 --> 05:16:31,200
spirit want to be able to run over game

8079
05:16:31,200 --> 05:16:32,920
Gladiators take these outer Towers so

8080
05:16:32,920 --> 05:16:34,680
they can disrupt that ancient farming

8081
05:16:34,680 --> 05:16:35,920
and they're going to go straight to it

8082
05:16:35,920 --> 05:16:38,080
no hesitant SE whatsoever immediate coil

8083
05:16:38,080 --> 05:16:39,520
put on to Quinn but they don't really

8084
05:16:39,520 --> 05:16:40,558
have the strength to be able to bring

8085
05:16:40,558 --> 05:16:42,600
him down just yet protected by all of

8086
05:16:42,600 --> 05:16:44,638
gaming Gladiators who again they saw

8087
05:16:44,638 --> 05:16:46,120
team SP in the bottom Lane show up as

8088
05:16:46,120 --> 05:16:47,360
five they will do the same here in the

8089
05:16:47,360 --> 05:16:50,200
mid lane Quinn looks to find his Mark

8090
05:16:50,200 --> 05:16:52,240
looks to see if he can drive right on

8091
05:16:52,240 --> 05:16:54,878
through and straight to moska he'll find

8092
05:16:54,878 --> 05:16:56,240
him here in the corner clear out most of

8093
05:16:56,240 --> 05:16:57,760
the trees but L is actually going to

8094
05:16:57,760 --> 05:17:00,360
bounce back in here OPP but PO is going

8095
05:17:00,360 --> 05:17:02,240
to stand and fight as best he can but

8096
05:17:02,240 --> 05:17:04,600
off Ace immediately Laurel trying to

8097
05:17:04,600 --> 05:17:08,080
make his way out and oh the silent maybe

8098
05:17:08,080 --> 05:17:10,040
he gets clipped again he's dead couldn't

8099
05:17:10,040 --> 05:17:11,878
jump to his orb in

8100
05:17:11,878 --> 05:17:15,000
time yeah they get Ace but it does cost

8101
05:17:15,000 --> 05:17:17,200
them quite a bit as lurl was a big piece

8102
05:17:17,200 --> 05:17:19,160
of the momentum for team spirit here

8103
05:17:19,160 --> 05:17:20,958
tofu coming up big calling is just going

8104
05:17:20,958 --> 05:17:22,160
to be their biggest way to deal with

8105
05:17:22,160 --> 05:17:23,360
puck in these team fights if you can

8106
05:17:23,360 --> 05:17:24,920
land it it's probably a dead Puck you

8107
05:17:24,920 --> 05:17:26,718
dead shot him back into it it's an

8108
05:17:26,718 --> 05:17:29,040
extended duration here once more that

8109
05:17:29,040 --> 05:17:30,520
fight got dragged out really nice

8110
05:17:30,520 --> 05:17:32,360
disengage from Spirit draw them back up

8111
05:17:32,360 --> 05:17:34,080
the ramp waste this Rolling Thunder

8112
05:17:34,080 --> 05:17:36,760
chasing moska on The Cliff yoro gets

8113
05:17:36,760 --> 05:17:39,280
another pretty good angle you can see

8114
05:17:39,280 --> 05:17:40,320
the aggressiveness they're trying to

8115
05:17:40,320 --> 05:17:41,440
play with this Beast Master right now

8116
05:17:41,440 --> 05:17:43,320
they're taking the push to gaming not

8117
05:17:43,320 --> 05:17:45,760
playing defensive at all and once more

8118
05:17:45,760 --> 05:17:47,160
the aggression continues no rolling

8119
05:17:47,160 --> 05:17:49,798
thunder for Quinn right here to try and

8120
05:17:49,798 --> 05:17:51,480
protect him another swashbuckle up at a

8121
05:17:51,480 --> 05:17:53,120
second he's actually going to turn and

8122
05:17:53,120 --> 05:17:55,080
fight as best as possible but the puck

8123
05:17:55,080 --> 05:17:57,200
is going to be the end of Quinn I

8124
05:17:57,200 --> 05:17:58,520
thought he was going to swash buckle

8125
05:17:58,520 --> 05:18:00,480
down and away from the trees maybe that

8126
05:18:00,480 --> 05:18:03,520
was an error this is looking all spirit

8127
05:18:03,520 --> 05:18:05,000
in this first 50 minutes here they're

8128
05:18:05,000 --> 05:18:06,680
getting a lot for their Beast the start

8129
05:18:06,680 --> 05:18:08,280
for yoro and now it's just going to have

8130
05:18:08,280 --> 05:18:10,440
to come back back down to the FL and

8131
05:18:10,440 --> 05:18:11,520
clearing through the Ancients to put

8132
05:18:11,520 --> 05:18:13,520
tachu in a spot where he can start to

8133
05:18:13,520 --> 05:18:15,360
take these fights this is a position

8134
05:18:15,360 --> 05:18:17,520
we've not seen gaming in in a while

8135
05:18:17,520 --> 05:18:19,000
right in this tournament especially they

8136
05:18:19,000 --> 05:18:20,520
are usually the ones with a very strong

8137
05:18:20,520 --> 05:18:22,240
lead going into this 15 20 minute mid

8138
05:18:22,240 --> 05:18:23,480
game period all of a sudden they're on

8139
05:18:23,480 --> 05:18:25,120
the back fo double damage definitely

8140
05:18:25,120 --> 05:18:28,360
going to help accelerate Theo here but

8141
05:18:28,360 --> 05:18:30,240
we talked about the resiliency of this

8142
05:18:30,240 --> 05:18:31,400
team right there's a reason they're here

8143
05:18:31,400 --> 05:18:32,440
in this Grand finals there's a reason

8144
05:18:32,440 --> 05:18:33,680
they've been in a lot of them too this

8145
05:18:33,680 --> 05:18:35,000
is not a team that can only play from

8146
05:18:35,000 --> 05:18:36,440
ahead they're going to have to show some

8147
05:18:36,440 --> 05:18:37,958
resiliency here and playing a little bit

8148
05:18:37,958 --> 05:18:40,200
from behind particularly with I mean

8149
05:18:40,200 --> 05:18:41,638
maybe Ace's times but honestly he's

8150
05:18:41,638 --> 05:18:43,718
found a lot given his start I'm

8151
05:18:43,718 --> 05:18:45,958
surprised at how rich he is yeah he's

8152
05:18:45,958 --> 05:18:47,600
got three deaths I think his bear has

8153
05:18:47,600 --> 05:18:49,120
died like five different times in this

8154
05:18:49,120 --> 05:18:51,520
game but still second in the network

8155
05:18:51,520 --> 05:18:53,798
chart still though Spirit clearly

8156
05:18:53,798 --> 05:18:55,718
holding the tempo control of this game

8157
05:18:55,718 --> 05:18:57,520
they're up by 3K they're got to be

8158
05:18:57,520 --> 05:18:58,878
feeling pretty good about it even if

8159
05:18:58,878 --> 05:19:00,240
they couldn't stop the jyro copter from

8160
05:19:00,240 --> 05:19:01,718
clearing out Stacks they don't have to

8161
05:19:01,718 --> 05:19:03,600
do it the first time around just taking

8162
05:19:03,600 --> 05:19:05,920
these outer towers and trying to scrunch

8163
05:19:05,920 --> 05:19:07,638
in the map a little bit yeah take

8164
05:19:07,638 --> 05:19:09,240
advantage of the fact that they is not

8165
05:19:09,240 --> 05:19:12,160
ready and it is dead even that would

8166
05:19:12,160 --> 05:19:13,440
have been my prediction before this

8167
05:19:13,440 --> 05:19:15,000
series as

8168
05:19:15,000 --> 05:19:18,040
well goes to show I mean respecting the

8169
05:19:18,040 --> 05:19:19,760
ace timing as well too like this

8170
05:19:19,760 --> 05:19:21,520
Radiance on the bear we have seen them

8171
05:19:21,520 --> 05:19:23,320
do an incredible amount of work with it

8172
05:19:23,320 --> 05:19:26,440
and it's coming soon I think team spirit

8173
05:19:26,440 --> 05:19:28,440
really want to finish off this mid Tower

8174
05:19:28,440 --> 05:19:30,440
before those timings reach the agonum

8175
05:19:30,440 --> 05:19:34,120
scepter on Danio the radiance on Ace

8176
05:19:34,120 --> 05:19:36,520
here and these are acceleration items

8177
05:19:36,520 --> 05:19:38,240
that's the thing if if you give gam in

8178
05:19:38,240 --> 05:19:40,160
time to their big farm in the radiance

8179
05:19:40,160 --> 05:19:42,760
and the agum SE on Daio those let you

8180
05:19:42,760 --> 05:19:43,958
fight but they also let you just clear

8181
05:19:43,958 --> 05:19:46,080
the map so holding these Tower UPS if

8182
05:19:46,080 --> 05:19:48,040
you can limit the space they can use

8183
05:19:48,040 --> 05:19:49,480
these farming items on in terms of the

8184
05:19:49,480 --> 05:19:50,840
sides of the map that's going to feel

8185
05:19:50,840 --> 05:19:51,878
really nice with this tream protect

8186
05:19:51,878 --> 05:19:54,440
their lineup moska did not go for Living

8187
05:19:54,440 --> 05:19:56,080
Armor points early hasn't even needed

8188
05:19:56,080 --> 05:19:57,520
them at this point and all three tier

8189
05:19:57,520 --> 05:20:00,798
ones are up another aggressive kofu with

8190
05:20:00,798 --> 05:20:02,400
the calling trying to protect mea just

8191
05:20:02,400 --> 05:20:03,958
outside of that silence use the snowball

8192
05:20:03,958 --> 05:20:05,680
trying to get some distance nice dead

8193
05:20:05,680 --> 05:20:07,240
shot though actually hit laurl in the

8194
05:20:07,240 --> 05:20:09,400
background yeah but the the exchange on

8195
05:20:09,400 --> 05:20:11,840
the other side of the map Ace going down

8196
05:20:11,840 --> 05:20:14,360
to yoro again with this desolator

8197
05:20:14,360 --> 05:20:16,680
instant reveal gets two charges on it

8198
05:20:16,680 --> 05:20:18,558
plus a bear kill as he was just pushing

8199
05:20:18,558 --> 05:20:21,718
towards that Radiance 700 off and this

8200
05:20:21,718 --> 05:20:23,558
Tower dies this is an influential tower

8201
05:20:23,558 --> 05:20:24,840
for what gaming want to do on the map

8202
05:20:24,840 --> 05:20:26,600
because now both ancients are exposed

8203
05:20:26,600 --> 05:20:28,120
and Y Toro straight in there he would

8204
05:20:28,120 --> 05:20:29,920
have liked to have found that stack but

8205
05:20:29,920 --> 05:20:32,080
he will be happy to take the net worth

8206
05:20:32,080 --> 05:20:34,638
away from Dario a hero that just needs

8207
05:20:34,638 --> 05:20:36,718
these camps

8208
05:20:36,718 --> 05:20:38,798
up now you're going to have to need a

8209
05:20:38,798 --> 05:20:40,320
bit of a backup plan if you're gaming

8210
05:20:40,320 --> 05:20:42,200
Gladiators you no longer have that good

8211
05:20:42,200 --> 05:20:43,878
control over the double ancient Stacks

8212
05:20:43,878 --> 05:20:45,360
like you're talking about and look at

8213
05:20:45,360 --> 05:20:48,200
this fast Shard for yoro 2 yeah this is

8214
05:20:48,200 --> 05:20:49,840
where Weaver is absolutely terrifying

8215
05:20:49,840 --> 05:20:51,440
you're getting the extra geminate hit

8216
05:20:51,440 --> 05:20:52,878
off the suuchi going through everybody

8217
05:20:52,878 --> 05:20:54,480
with an early desolator these Heroes

8218
05:20:54,480 --> 05:20:55,718
just don't have the armor to deal with

8219
05:20:55,718 --> 05:20:58,040
this right now you don't burst him he

8220
05:20:58,040 --> 05:21:00,000
wants to play Super aggressive and like

8221
05:21:00,000 --> 05:21:02,760
get on top of people which against these

8222
05:21:02,760 --> 05:21:04,638
kind of silences could play against them

8223
05:21:04,638 --> 05:21:06,000
that's why it's very important for them

8224
05:21:06,000 --> 05:21:07,558
to get this a just get this second life

8225
05:21:07,558 --> 05:21:09,558
it gives them time to get bkb up on

8226
05:21:09,558 --> 05:21:12,040
utoro so he can't get punished just yet

8227
05:21:12,040 --> 05:21:13,760
I mean this man has absolutely no chill

8228
05:21:13,760 --> 05:21:15,240
he's not here to win an AIS he's here to

8229
05:21:15,240 --> 05:21:17,280
take it away from you and right now he

8230
05:21:17,280 --> 05:21:19,600
is controlling the tempo of this game

8231
05:21:19,600 --> 05:21:21,400
it's going to force g into a smoke that

8232
05:21:21,400 --> 05:21:24,160
yields nothing right there nowhere here

8233
05:21:24,160 --> 05:21:26,200
in time and still missing those big core

8234
05:21:26,200 --> 05:21:27,798
items to take the fight anyway you're

8235
05:21:27,798 --> 05:21:30,520
still 300 gold off this Radiance for Ace

8236
05:21:30,520 --> 05:21:32,840
that's your big 5v5

8237
05:21:32,840 --> 05:21:35,920
timing just an awkward Point yoro

8238
05:21:35,920 --> 05:21:37,600
playing this game way too fast right now

8239
05:21:37,600 --> 05:21:39,200
and the Beast Master from collapse

8240
05:21:39,200 --> 05:21:40,520
speeding everything up Helm of the

8241
05:21:40,520 --> 05:21:42,958
overlord is already done by the way so

8242
05:21:42,958 --> 05:21:46,040
this map pressure is going to

8243
05:21:48,958 --> 05:21:52,240
escalate gaming Gladiators really not

8244
05:21:52,240 --> 05:21:54,200
able to do much besides just kind of

8245
05:21:54,200 --> 05:21:56,958
make sure Danio doesn't get smoke ganked

8246
05:21:56,958 --> 05:21:58,520
playing around him heavily here comes

8247
05:21:58,520 --> 05:22:00,440
the pressure from team spirit though

8248
05:22:00,440 --> 05:22:02,160
radiant's done this is a good point to

8249
05:22:02,160 --> 05:22:03,240
get it done if you want to defend this

8250
05:22:03,240 --> 05:22:05,920
tier one mid a really fast time lapse

8251
05:22:05,920 --> 05:22:07,840
there you could really y Toro I think

8252
05:22:07,840 --> 05:22:09,840
felt like he was overextended there if

8253
05:22:09,840 --> 05:22:11,600
he gets caught once by the silences or

8254
05:22:11,600 --> 05:22:13,160
chances he just dies behind the tower

8255
05:22:13,160 --> 05:22:15,320
and then that agis may be useless he may

8256
05:22:15,320 --> 05:22:17,280
just die twice in a row and that's why

8257
05:22:17,280 --> 05:22:18,520
this build is starting to come together

8258
05:22:18,520 --> 05:22:20,160
for the ages right cuz yoro still

8259
05:22:20,160 --> 05:22:22,000
doesn't have a defensive item the global

8260
05:22:22,000 --> 05:22:24,520
still very effective here against Spirit

8261
05:22:24,520 --> 05:22:26,920
Laurel also considering a bkb this game

8262
05:22:26,920 --> 05:22:28,320
on Puck early just to deal with the

8263
05:22:28,320 --> 05:22:29,600
calling and the global silence that's

8264
05:22:29,600 --> 05:22:31,920
coming out G have a lot of tools to lock

8265
05:22:31,920 --> 05:22:33,520
down these Mobility Heroes if they can

8266
05:22:33,520 --> 05:22:35,558
find them right now moska just doing

8267
05:22:35,558 --> 05:22:39,360
some scouting do manka but there's

8268
05:22:39,360 --> 05:22:41,680
nowhere for him to really run he knows

8269
05:22:41,680 --> 05:22:43,558
it too he's definitely been caught but

8270
05:22:43,558 --> 05:22:45,200
he got some good information information

8271
05:22:45,200 --> 05:22:46,878
that'll lead to the pick off on Ace he

8272
05:22:46,878 --> 05:22:49,040
saw all those Heroes and he said guys

8273
05:22:49,040 --> 05:22:51,400
this lone Druid is alone in the Top Lane

8274
05:22:51,400 --> 05:22:54,080
again kill him the single Target

8275
05:22:54,080 --> 05:22:55,958
physical first is way too fast for this

8276
05:22:55,958 --> 05:22:58,200
true form to even be considered in terms

8277
05:22:58,200 --> 05:23:01,600
of casting it they just had AES

8278
05:23:01,600 --> 05:23:05,480
number Radiance reveal down the drain as

8279
05:23:05,480 --> 05:23:06,798
his timings are going to get prolonged

8280
05:23:06,798 --> 05:23:08,920
yet again and collapse he's just Bing it

8281
05:23:08,920 --> 05:23:10,920
up not too worried about playing on game

8282
05:23:10,920 --> 05:23:12,080
inside of the map right now just wants

8283
05:23:12,080 --> 05:23:14,600
to hit his own bkb it looks like team

8284
05:23:14,600 --> 05:23:15,600
spirit they're just going to work

8285
05:23:15,600 --> 05:23:19,000
towards a triple bkb timing eventually

8286
05:23:19,000 --> 05:23:20,840
look towards that second ran with it get

8287
05:23:20,840 --> 05:23:23,000
the spell and debuff Immunity up for the

8288
05:23:23,000 --> 05:23:24,240
silences that are causing them problems

8289
05:23:24,240 --> 05:23:25,718
in the fight then you're not too worried

8290
05:23:25,718 --> 05:23:27,080
about anything as Quinn is getting

8291
05:23:27,080 --> 05:23:28,680
shredded by the death yeah even if you

8292
05:23:28,680 --> 05:23:30,080
get out the Rolling Thunder the physical

8293
05:23:30,080 --> 05:23:32,240
damage from yoro is too much for him to

8294
05:23:32,240 --> 05:23:34,200
handle tofu was kind of desperate wanted

8295
05:23:34,200 --> 05:23:35,798
to be able to get that kill on mea maybe

8296
05:23:35,798 --> 05:23:37,200
trying to take away the Aegis but

8297
05:23:37,200 --> 05:23:39,400
frankly he doesn't do nearly enough

8298
05:23:39,400 --> 05:23:41,000
damage right now to deal with this carry

8299
05:23:41,000 --> 05:23:43,240
even on low HP like this missed the dead

8300
05:23:43,240 --> 05:23:45,840
shot on miror managed to side step that

8301
05:23:45,840 --> 05:23:47,760
one and they'll dive tofu pretty easily

8302
05:23:47,760 --> 05:23:49,200
ataro does be to get off the timeline

8303
05:23:49,200 --> 05:23:50,878
Serv so barely meanwhile salary's picked

8304
05:23:50,878 --> 05:23:54,480
off in mid team spirit they are

8305
05:23:54,480 --> 05:23:56,798
absolutely outplaying gaming Gladiators

8306
05:23:56,798 --> 05:23:58,400
right now on the map they just know all

8307
05:23:58,400 --> 05:24:00,878
of these heroes are getting picked apart

8308
05:24:00,878 --> 05:24:02,440
there's just seems to be no response

8309
05:24:02,440 --> 05:24:04,040
whatsoever from these Gladiators I mean

8310
05:24:04,040 --> 05:24:05,600
there's nowhere to run right you you

8311
05:24:05,600 --> 05:24:07,400
need to combine the damage here on gam

8312
05:24:07,400 --> 05:24:08,840
to get anything done right now and

8313
05:24:08,840 --> 05:24:10,520
instead it's just team spirit going on

8314
05:24:10,520 --> 05:24:12,480
you on multiple Lanes so you can't group

8315
05:24:12,480 --> 05:24:14,280
up a is still up for 2 minutes here

8316
05:24:14,280 --> 05:24:16,320
eight deso charges already done for y

8317
05:24:16,320 --> 05:24:19,400
too as he is just slowly claiming your

8318
05:24:19,400 --> 05:24:21,760
soul this is going to escalate fast this

8319
05:24:21,760 --> 05:24:23,520
is a scaling lineup too with all the

8320
05:24:23,520 --> 05:24:24,920
oras they can bring to the table the

8321
05:24:24,920 --> 05:24:26,240
swarm's going to go through you have

8322
05:24:26,240 --> 05:24:28,000
tusk physical damage to pour in on top

8323
05:24:28,000 --> 05:24:30,680
of it all and a crystal is for yoro I

8324
05:24:30,680 --> 05:24:32,200
mean how many aggressive items does he

8325
05:24:32,200 --> 05:24:33,718
need in this

8326
05:24:33,718 --> 05:24:36,240
game I love the fact he's like yeah I I

8327
05:24:36,240 --> 05:24:38,400
don't need that b KB yet still have to

8328
05:24:38,400 --> 05:24:41,120
just for another minute and a half and

8329
05:24:41,120 --> 05:24:43,440
considering the pace of game right now

8330
05:24:43,440 --> 05:24:44,638
it does kind of feel like he's going to

8331
05:24:44,638 --> 05:24:47,558
get that bkb once the agents expires

8332
05:24:47,558 --> 05:24:48,760
because this is going to be another team

8333
05:24:48,760 --> 05:24:50,520
fight and perhaps another objective

8334
05:24:50,520 --> 05:24:53,280
taken 21 minute wisdom room coming up

8335
05:24:53,280 --> 05:24:55,320
Tormentor an object as well silence

8336
05:24:55,320 --> 05:24:56,440
already going out they're trying to lock

8337
05:24:56,440 --> 05:24:57,798
down this Weaver trying to stop him from

8338
05:24:57,798 --> 05:24:59,480
killing anybody it gets off the time

8339
05:24:59,480 --> 05:25:02,120
lapse though horses a little bit of a

8340
05:25:02,120 --> 05:25:04,520
resources out of gaming Gladiators they

8341
05:25:04,520 --> 05:25:06,000
just throwing some damage around barl

8342
05:25:06,000 --> 05:25:08,360
looking at that back line you got to be

8343
05:25:08,360 --> 05:25:09,718
be careful of giving Dao these good

8344
05:25:09,718 --> 05:25:11,400
black targets up front as they're going

8345
05:25:11,400 --> 05:25:14,520
to trade a bunch of the Bears HP they're

8346
05:25:14,520 --> 05:25:16,680
still looking for over here they the

8347
05:25:16,680 --> 05:25:19,520
detection catch him out something is

8348
05:25:19,520 --> 05:25:20,958
going wrong with the detection on this

8349
05:25:20,958 --> 05:25:23,000
Tre and for sure he's just getting way

8350
05:25:23,000 --> 05:25:25,000
too much information way too deep right

8351
05:25:25,000 --> 05:25:27,600
now you spirit will play it safe play it

8352
05:25:27,600 --> 05:25:29,520
slow agis out in 50 seconds so you have

8353
05:25:29,520 --> 05:25:31,280
to think about the timer here look at

8354
05:25:31,280 --> 05:25:33,558
that first damage Quinn caught by the

8355
05:25:33,558 --> 05:25:36,000
coil and instantly killed by utoro and

8356
05:25:36,000 --> 05:25:37,558
you can feel it utoro is seeing an

8357
05:25:37,558 --> 05:25:39,120
opportunity going to be able to cut down

8358
05:25:39,120 --> 05:25:40,878
celery and now he goes in for the kill

8359
05:25:40,878 --> 05:25:42,360
the AG of Stills expired but the rest of

8360
05:25:42,360 --> 05:25:44,240
his team provides the disabl so the

8361
05:25:44,240 --> 05:25:45,798
second life comes back up he's going to

8362
05:25:45,798 --> 05:25:48,080
shred through a looks over to tofu next

8363
05:25:48,080 --> 05:25:50,440
now last left perhaps Daio trying to run

8364
05:25:50,440 --> 05:25:52,440
him down Daio doing his best he can but

8365
05:25:52,440 --> 05:25:54,320
it againsts three different cores he

8366
05:25:54,320 --> 05:25:57,240
can't actually fight back he has to Oh

8367
05:25:57,240 --> 05:25:58,878
missing out of the Dead Shot y Toro is

8368
05:25:58,878 --> 05:26:00,160
Unstoppable he's just diving into the

8369
05:26:00,160 --> 05:26:01,840
base like it's nothing you just think

8370
05:26:01,840 --> 05:26:03,958
about it again 30 HP is the only thing

8371
05:26:03,958 --> 05:26:06,040
that'll save you from this man right now

8372
05:26:06,040 --> 05:26:07,600
he's just running Rampages through the

8373
05:26:07,600 --> 05:26:11,000
fight 12 in two at 22 minutes he is just

8374
05:26:11,000 --> 05:26:12,760
taking everything and more he has the

8375
05:26:12,760 --> 05:26:14,798
ORS to back him up this aggressive item

8376
05:26:14,798 --> 05:26:17,120
build has paid off in

8377
05:26:17,120 --> 05:26:20,000
Spades the aggressiveness of yoro I've

8378
05:26:20,000 --> 05:26:23,240
seen in very few players at TI before I

8379
05:26:23,240 --> 05:26:24,638
mean that play when he was he was more

8380
05:26:24,638 --> 05:26:26,320
playing get skewed into the base and

8381
05:26:26,320 --> 05:26:28,680
then he waveforms deeper into the base

8382
05:26:28,680 --> 05:26:30,320
that's the kind of aggression this guy's

8383
05:26:30,320 --> 05:26:31,920
playing with right now you got to play

8384
05:26:31,920 --> 05:26:33,638
to win you play not to lose it

8385
05:26:33,638 --> 05:26:36,200
eventually will happen right now team

8386
05:26:36,200 --> 05:26:37,878
spear just taking over the map really

8387
05:26:37,878 --> 05:26:40,200
good Wards on those fights will get Deed

8388
05:26:40,200 --> 05:26:41,840
from gaming but that's the power of what

8389
05:26:41,840 --> 05:26:43,840
moska is providing them with this tree

8390
05:26:43,840 --> 05:26:45,440
all of these fights and pickoffs they've

8391
05:26:45,440 --> 05:26:47,080
been scouted he's been on gaming side of

8392
05:26:47,080 --> 05:26:50,000
the map for a lot of it it's paid off to

8393
05:26:50,000 --> 05:26:52,120
a large degree this early Tre and

8394
05:26:52,120 --> 05:26:55,120
Shard doing some work and of course the

8395
05:26:55,120 --> 05:26:56,280
vision's really nice versus these

8396
05:26:56,280 --> 05:26:57,638
silencer lineups cuz if you're the one

8397
05:26:57,638 --> 05:26:59,558
initiating on gaming forcing out awkward

8398
05:26:59,558 --> 05:27:01,480
globals taking some damage on your

8399
05:27:01,480 --> 05:27:03,520
backline the fight gets very weird very

8400
05:27:03,520 --> 05:27:05,638
fast and suddenly Doro goes in he kills

8401
05:27:05,638 --> 05:27:07,240
somebody time lapses out there's a black

8402
05:27:07,240 --> 05:27:10,120
dragon porns fire on somebody else too

8403
05:27:10,120 --> 05:27:11,600
many fires to put out quite literally

8404
05:27:11,600 --> 05:27:13,760
here and once more moska just scouting

8405
05:27:13,760 --> 05:27:15,878
out the moves from gam gives him all the

8406
05:27:15,878 --> 05:27:17,600
setup in the

8407
05:27:17,600 --> 05:27:20,200
world is deadly man the cores from

8408
05:27:20,200 --> 05:27:22,320
Spirit are converging on Top Lane look

8409
05:27:22,320 --> 05:27:24,400
at moska man he doesn't care if he gets

8410
05:27:24,400 --> 05:27:26,360
caught as long as he gets information

8411
05:27:26,360 --> 05:27:29,040
for his team he knows all five Heroes of

8412
05:27:29,040 --> 05:27:31,040
game of Gladiators are up here so team

8413
05:27:31,040 --> 05:27:32,520
spirit are going to slowly approach

8414
05:27:32,520 --> 05:27:34,200
they're going to group up together and

8415
05:27:34,200 --> 05:27:36,280
take this fight yoro just timelaps to

8416
05:27:36,280 --> 05:27:38,240
the Fountain and back to get his bkb you

8417
05:27:38,240 --> 05:27:39,878
will not have time lapse for this fight

8418
05:27:39,878 --> 05:27:42,638
say I don't with the thre man coil it's

8419
05:27:42,638 --> 05:27:44,120
looking beautiful and you T right in

8420
05:27:44,120 --> 05:27:46,080
there with this fresh bkb to lay the

8421
05:27:46,080 --> 05:27:48,320
damage in these cores once again Ace has

8422
05:27:48,320 --> 05:27:50,280
no chance with the bear and of course

8423
05:27:50,280 --> 05:27:52,000
the Beast Master's going to lock down

8424
05:27:52,000 --> 05:27:53,798
that ball you're not going anywhere

8425
05:27:53,798 --> 05:27:55,680
Quinn they're going to catch more tofu

8426
05:27:55,680 --> 05:27:57,558
is going to be the last one down datu

8427
05:27:57,558 --> 05:28:00,718
only survives because of his TP

8428
05:28:00,718 --> 05:28:03,160
everything coming together triple bkb

8429
05:28:03,160 --> 05:28:05,400
instantly revealed all together on the

8430
05:28:05,400 --> 05:28:08,120
exact fight maposa sets up it's just

8431
05:28:08,120 --> 05:28:09,638
just beautiful gameplay here from team

8432
05:28:09,638 --> 05:28:11,160
spirit and gaming still searching for

8433
05:28:11,160 --> 05:28:13,240
answers because the second these fights

8434
05:28:13,240 --> 05:28:14,440
start they're already over they don't

8435
05:28:14,440 --> 05:28:17,160
even know they're coming yep yoro he

8436
05:28:17,160 --> 05:28:18,840
does not need an ultimate at all to take

8437
05:28:18,840 --> 05:28:20,200
these engagements when they are

8438
05:28:20,200 --> 05:28:21,840
completely one side it'll be more

8439
05:28:21,840 --> 05:28:24,400
objective pushing this is just a

8440
05:28:24,400 --> 05:28:26,480
beautiful Forman overgo setup you cannot

8441
05:28:26,480 --> 05:28:28,280
ask for anything more swarm hits

8442
05:28:28,280 --> 05:28:29,920
everybody and then you get to save Roar

8443
05:28:29,920 --> 05:28:32,280
for the Rolling Thunder after Ace goes

8444
05:28:32,280 --> 05:28:34,878
down to just right clicks I mean making

8445
05:28:34,878 --> 05:28:37,638
it look easy out here the item timings

8446
05:28:37,638 --> 05:28:38,798
the position

8447
05:28:38,798 --> 05:28:42,320
all of it is just so perfect for team

8448
05:28:42,320 --> 05:28:44,240
spirit That's The Power of vision this

8449
05:28:44,240 --> 05:28:46,360
is a team that won a TI previously off

8450
05:28:46,360 --> 05:28:48,160
of vision advantage and they're showing

8451
05:28:48,160 --> 05:28:50,080
why the Beast Master might have got

8452
05:28:50,080 --> 05:28:51,798
nerfed in this regard but moska doing

8453
05:28:51,798 --> 05:28:53,360
his best Hawk

8454
05:28:53,360 --> 05:28:55,160
impersonation if you want to be worried

8455
05:28:55,160 --> 05:28:57,360
about uh the Chen of gaming Gladiators I

8456
05:28:57,360 --> 05:28:59,120
think it's the train protector of team

8457
05:28:59,120 --> 05:29:01,480
spirit that may become a problem in this

8458
05:29:01,480 --> 05:29:03,480
series maybe there's just not enough

8459
05:29:03,480 --> 05:29:05,638
centuries in the world for you to buy to

8460
05:29:05,638 --> 05:29:07,600
catch this guy he's dewarding them too

8461
05:29:07,600 --> 05:29:08,798
that's the problem

8462
05:29:08,798 --> 05:29:10,480
they are lacking sries they are lacking

8463
05:29:10,480 --> 05:29:12,400
the detection no one wants to buy a gem

8464
05:29:12,400 --> 05:29:13,480
right now I you don't want to have to

8465
05:29:13,480 --> 05:29:15,360
buy a gem for a Tre protector but we're

8466
05:29:15,360 --> 05:29:17,240
getting to that point and every time one

8467
05:29:17,240 --> 05:29:18,520
of these fights goes wrong you fall a

8468
05:29:18,520 --> 05:29:20,718
little bit more behind with the I mean

8469
05:29:20,718 --> 05:29:22,080
core Heroes that don't want to function

8470
05:29:22,080 --> 05:29:23,280
in these team fights from behind right

8471
05:29:23,280 --> 05:29:25,200
particularly the gyropter this it here

8472
05:29:25,200 --> 05:29:26,680
you want to accelerate with the triangle

8473
05:29:26,680 --> 05:29:27,920
accelerate with the ancient camps put

8474
05:29:27,920 --> 05:29:29,718
him in a prime position like a Luna or

8475
05:29:29,718 --> 05:29:30,760
something where he goes in that fight

8476
05:29:30,760 --> 05:29:33,040
he's the absolute raid boss Daio has

8477
05:29:33,040 --> 05:29:35,558
escaped these fights but across his

8478
05:29:35,558 --> 05:29:38,360
teammates tombstones as he cannot output

8479
05:29:38,360 --> 05:29:39,958
the Firepower to match what team spirit

8480
05:29:39,958 --> 05:29:41,320
are bringing with the ball right now and

8481
05:29:41,320 --> 05:29:42,840
everything is looking towards this next

8482
05:29:42,840 --> 05:29:46,120
ran which team spirit would be very very

8483
05:29:46,120 --> 05:29:47,920
happy to collect and put an AIS on yoro

8484
05:29:47,920 --> 05:29:50,600
with his aggressive DPS build not to

8485
05:29:50,600 --> 05:29:52,280
mention I mean I mean Laurel is picking

8486
05:29:52,280 --> 05:29:53,558
up the speed right he's just going for

8487
05:29:53,558 --> 05:29:55,840
the melom right click Puck it's also a

8488
05:29:55,840 --> 05:29:58,200
fearsome late game Beast especially when

8489
05:29:58,200 --> 05:29:59,958
you have that Beast Master or pumping in

8490
05:29:59,958 --> 05:30:01,480
attack speed to everybody on this lineup

8491
05:30:01,480 --> 05:30:04,040
you have tag teams above the physical

8492
05:30:04,040 --> 05:30:05,440
you're going to have multiple scaling

8493
05:30:05,440 --> 05:30:07,360
right click cores here for team spirit

8494
05:30:07,360 --> 05:30:09,360
you're going to need on gaming at some

8495
05:30:09,360 --> 05:30:11,600
point you're going to need survivability

8496
05:30:11,600 --> 05:30:14,200
satanics AC anything that buys you time

8497
05:30:14,200 --> 05:30:15,480
in this

8498
05:30:15,480 --> 05:30:18,320
fight gaming Gladiators getting caught

8499
05:30:18,320 --> 05:30:21,160
there the overgrowth not quite landing

8500
05:30:21,160 --> 05:30:23,280
on to Quinn he'll survive as a result of

8501
05:30:23,280 --> 05:30:25,040
that utoro still going to have a poke at

8502
05:30:25,040 --> 05:30:27,200
them though quickly time lapses away

8503
05:30:27,200 --> 05:30:29,520
before the silences catch him

8504
05:30:29,520 --> 05:30:32,600
out he's just so aggressive man he's

8505
05:30:32,600 --> 05:30:34,080
going to start back away with the rest

8506
05:30:34,080 --> 05:30:36,200
of his team as you said 19,000 net worth

8507
05:30:36,200 --> 05:30:38,400
lead they're very comfortable it's

8508
05:30:38,400 --> 05:30:40,680
really just not slipping up at this

8509
05:30:40,680 --> 05:30:42,558
point in time that starts with being

8510
05:30:42,558 --> 05:30:44,798
able to get the second ran of the game

8511
05:30:44,798 --> 05:30:46,798
and then comes The High Ground push

8512
05:30:46,798 --> 05:30:49,320
which gam of Gladiators I don't know how

8513
05:30:49,320 --> 05:30:50,718
do you what do you feel better about a

8514
05:30:50,718 --> 05:30:54,240
Roshan contest or a high ground play

8515
05:30:54,240 --> 05:30:57,840
uh maybe game two High Ground Play for

8516
05:30:57,840 --> 05:30:59,680
sure right you let him go into you abuse

8517
05:30:59,680 --> 05:31:00,878
the fact that the callings a really

8518
05:31:00,878 --> 05:31:02,400
strong defensive spell you catch the

8519
05:31:02,400 --> 05:31:04,200
tree and first that's a nice pickoff

8520
05:31:04,200 --> 05:31:05,480
that is actually really nice with the

8521
05:31:05,480 --> 05:31:08,240
gem on the ground yeah okay so needed a

8522
05:31:08,240 --> 05:31:09,878
gem in this game moska will give it to

8523
05:31:09,878 --> 05:31:12,320
you that's a big pick up limit the

8524
05:31:12,320 --> 05:31:14,160
vision limit Mosa's aggressive

8525
05:31:14,160 --> 05:31:16,200
positioning that was very deep right

8526
05:31:16,200 --> 05:31:17,320
especially for team spirit looking

8527
05:31:17,320 --> 05:31:18,840
towards this next row Sean they have the

8528
05:31:18,840 --> 05:31:20,480
Beast Master creep in the pit scouting

8529
05:31:20,480 --> 05:31:23,600
it out a rich man's Hawk for lack of

8530
05:31:23,600 --> 05:31:24,680
anything

8531
05:31:24,680 --> 05:31:27,240
better just waiting waiting on their

8532
05:31:27,240 --> 05:31:29,480
Vision yeah the sad part for game of

8533
05:31:29,480 --> 05:31:31,160
Gladiators is they can't actually do

8534
05:31:31,160 --> 05:31:33,400
anything off of that play besides

8535
05:31:33,400 --> 05:31:34,920
getting a little bit more farmed than

8536
05:31:34,920 --> 05:31:36,280
normal they'll be able to push out some

8537
05:31:36,280 --> 05:31:38,240
of the Sid Lanes I assume they know know

8538
05:31:38,240 --> 05:31:39,558
that team spirit's going to be doing

8539
05:31:39,558 --> 05:31:41,120
Roshan sometime soon of course they're

8540
05:31:41,120 --> 05:31:42,920
doing it right now and it happens so

8541
05:31:42,920 --> 05:31:46,160
quickly it gives you such a small window

8542
05:31:46,160 --> 05:31:47,878
if you're uh gaming Gladiators to

8543
05:31:47,878 --> 05:31:49,160
actually be able to contest so you're

8544
05:31:49,160 --> 05:31:50,360
right they're going to play For The High

8545
05:31:50,360 --> 05:31:52,240
Ground they're going to try and see if

8546
05:31:52,240 --> 05:31:55,680
they can make team spirit slip on that

8547
05:31:55,680 --> 05:31:57,480
staircase just a question what are they

8548
05:31:57,480 --> 05:31:59,200
going to get up for that High Ground

8549
05:31:59,200 --> 05:32:01,320
defense right it's the datalis on datu

8550
05:32:01,320 --> 05:32:02,878
that's going to be the big DPS item here

8551
05:32:02,878 --> 05:32:04,320
Ace is just I mean he's just going

8552
05:32:04,320 --> 05:32:06,120
wraith bands he didn't even get to

8553
05:32:06,120 --> 05:32:07,400
anything else in this time period it's

8554
05:32:07,400 --> 05:32:09,120
just going to be armor up try and

8555
05:32:09,120 --> 05:32:11,360
survive the initial burst now these W BS

8556
05:32:11,360 --> 05:32:13,080
are pretty nice first team Spirits minus

8557
05:32:13,080 --> 05:32:15,600
on the R so they are very good value I

8558
05:32:15,600 --> 05:32:17,320
don't blame him for doing this but in

8559
05:32:17,320 --> 05:32:18,718
that other lone Drew game we saw I mean

8560
05:32:18,718 --> 05:32:20,120
he had a full Harpoon before he went

8561
05:32:20,120 --> 05:32:22,120
back for these waii bands so tells you

8562
05:32:22,120 --> 05:32:23,878
how far behind he is off that you know

8563
05:32:23,878 --> 05:32:25,558
first 15 minutes team spirit shutting

8564
05:32:25,558 --> 05:32:28,120
him down right now and the question is

8565
05:32:28,120 --> 05:32:30,280
how do you want to go High Ground cuz

8566
05:32:30,280 --> 05:32:31,600
there is a calling to fight into there

8567
05:32:31,600 --> 05:32:32,920
is a rolling thunder that can abuse you

8568
05:32:32,920 --> 05:32:34,480
on the choke points there's the radiance

8569
05:32:34,480 --> 05:32:36,120
burn with mischance and a resummon

8570
05:32:36,120 --> 05:32:38,520
assuming it's hard to jump Ace initially

8571
05:32:38,520 --> 05:32:40,360
and of course Global can bail out any

8572
05:32:40,360 --> 05:32:43,400
sort of initiation from the tus for the

8573
05:32:43,400 --> 05:32:46,840
Beast see how strong yoro really feels

8574
05:32:46,840 --> 05:32:48,200
he is if he thinks he can just walk up

8575
05:32:48,200 --> 05:32:49,798
and start hitting this tier three

8576
05:32:49,798 --> 05:32:51,680
wouldn't surprise me maybe that's why

8577
05:32:51,680 --> 05:32:53,718
he's gone Scotty here level 20 done for

8578
05:32:53,718 --> 05:32:55,280
the Weaver with Scotty completed a

8579
05:32:55,280 --> 05:32:58,680
double damage Rune and a quiver oh yeah

8580
05:32:58,680 --> 05:33:00,440
I I mean if you get hit once by this

8581
05:33:00,440 --> 05:33:02,000
Weaver I think you're gone on the

8582
05:33:02,000 --> 05:33:03,798
supports and that's a huge problem for

8583
05:33:03,798 --> 05:33:05,798
Dao as well because he doesn't have that

8584
05:33:05,798 --> 05:33:07,920
satanic buildup yet so he doesn't have

8585
05:33:07,920 --> 05:33:10,040
sustain to be able to stand toe against

8586
05:33:10,040 --> 05:33:11,760
the Weaver for too long Ace I don't know

8587
05:33:11,760 --> 05:33:13,160
if you know what's coming for you right

8588
05:33:13,160 --> 05:33:15,760
now but you're not going to like

8589
05:33:15,760 --> 05:33:17,920
it it's going to be a shot to the back

8590
05:33:17,920 --> 05:33:20,480
of the head he

8591
05:33:20,480 --> 05:33:24,638
gone Blown Away by yoro and they catch

8592
05:33:24,638 --> 05:33:25,920
Quinn in the mid lane they don't need

8593
05:33:25,920 --> 05:33:27,878
utoro to make this kind of play Laurel

8594
05:33:27,878 --> 05:33:30,280
activates his bkb to catch the opposing

8595
05:33:30,280 --> 05:33:32,878
mid laner and with two dead a double

8596
05:33:32,878 --> 05:33:35,480
damage activated team Spirits are all

8597
05:33:35,480 --> 05:33:36,958
but just waiting for the creep wave to

8598
05:33:36,958 --> 05:33:38,798
catch up with them well that's one way

8599
05:33:38,798 --> 05:33:40,360
to break The High Ground just one shot

8600
05:33:40,360 --> 05:33:42,638
an enemy off Lane carry here oh and uh

8601
05:33:42,638 --> 05:33:44,400
force it with a double damage here the

8602
05:33:44,400 --> 05:33:47,040
Toro has AC Ora behind him now as well

8603
05:33:47,040 --> 05:33:49,798
so that deso plus the stor plus the AC

8604
05:33:49,798 --> 05:33:50,920
is just going to amp this physical

8605
05:33:50,920 --> 05:33:52,240
through the roof right now which makes

8606
05:33:52,240 --> 05:33:53,360
this High Ground Siege a lot more

8607
05:33:53,360 --> 05:33:54,798
tempting here it goes through the jump

8608
05:33:54,798 --> 05:33:56,760
bkb immediately activated by Daio but

8609
05:33:56,760 --> 05:33:59,080
there's that physical damage Daio he can

8610
05:33:59,080 --> 05:34:01,280
actually stand up against yoro and has

8611
05:34:01,280 --> 05:34:03,120
backo yeah he's just going to go for it

8612
05:34:03,120 --> 05:34:07,760
t already got it oh No Way the final

8613
05:34:07,760 --> 05:34:10,240
little bit of damage required yoro can

8614
05:34:10,240 --> 05:34:13,440
claim it yoro boss this man knows no

8615
05:34:13,440 --> 05:34:15,160
fear no limits right now he's just

8616
05:34:15,160 --> 05:34:17,080
taking your base at 30 minutes a

8617
05:34:17,080 --> 05:34:18,680
position Gan is used to putting their

8618
05:34:18,680 --> 05:34:21,878
opponents in the news has been full

8619
05:34:21,878 --> 05:34:24,240
taught here as team spe have just given

8620
05:34:24,240 --> 05:34:25,718
them nothing to the map it feels like

8621
05:34:25,718 --> 05:34:28,440
for 15 20 minutes Ace can't even escape

8622
05:34:28,440 --> 05:34:30,320
the tier 3es right now just going to

8623
05:34:30,320 --> 05:34:31,680
have to take a high ground defense

8624
05:34:31,680 --> 05:34:35,600
without your carry watch another Lane

8625
05:34:35,600 --> 05:34:37,958
disappear would not be surprised they

8626
05:34:37,958 --> 05:34:39,958
stop this without Daio I mean I think

8627
05:34:39,958 --> 05:34:41,638
Vera can also jump if he really wants to

8628
05:34:41,638 --> 05:34:44,320
just force the issue his tusar is hella

8629
05:34:44,320 --> 05:34:47,878
tanky right now gossamer cave drum happy

8630
05:34:47,878 --> 05:34:49,240
to start the engagement particularly if

8631
05:34:49,240 --> 05:34:51,160
you can find a good core Target he got

8632
05:34:51,160 --> 05:34:53,840
feared on the jump that was that was

8633
05:34:53,840 --> 05:34:55,200
incredibly impressive actually but it

8634
05:34:55,200 --> 05:34:57,240
will not yield them the fight and it'll

8635
05:34:57,240 --> 05:34:59,200
be a second

8636
05:34:59,200 --> 05:35:02,798
lane two lanes Barracks up for team

8637
05:35:02,798 --> 05:35:05,840
spirits and they still have a minute and

8638
05:35:05,840 --> 05:35:08,718
a half left on that second line for the

8639
05:35:08,718 --> 05:35:11,840
Weaver that final push I mean if you're

8640
05:35:11,840 --> 05:35:14,280
team spirit you're here playing a full

8641
05:35:14,280 --> 05:35:16,400
best of five against gaming Gladiators

8642
05:35:16,400 --> 05:35:18,760
why not make the first game quick just

8643
05:35:18,760 --> 05:35:20,558
for your own sake yeah give them a taste

8644
05:35:20,558 --> 05:35:22,240
of their own medicine

8645
05:35:22,240 --> 05:35:24,920
uh-huh and show that the zoo is indeed

8646
05:35:24,920 --> 05:35:26,638
not dead that's the scary part of this

8647
05:35:26,638 --> 05:35:28,440
game for me you have collapsed on a hero

8648
05:35:28,440 --> 05:35:30,080
that I mean they have been incredibly

8649
05:35:30,080 --> 05:35:31,480
proficient with right this was a first

8650
05:35:31,480 --> 05:35:33,920
phase ban at Riad for a reason it is a

8651
05:35:33,920 --> 05:35:35,718
collapse signature hero but it's not one

8652
05:35:35,718 --> 05:35:36,878
of those big jump stunners that

8653
05:35:36,878 --> 05:35:38,480
everybody is afraid of they're afraid of

8654
05:35:38,480 --> 05:35:40,480
the collapse Magnus the the collapse

8655
05:35:40,480 --> 05:35:42,240
stunners this is a hero that just took

8656
05:35:42,240 --> 05:35:43,760
over the map he farmed he played his

8657
05:35:43,760 --> 05:35:45,120
game with the atoro and it was the raw

8658
05:35:45,120 --> 05:35:47,040
aggression of objective taking the put

8659
05:35:47,040 --> 05:35:49,840
gaming on the back foot it's a scary

8660
05:35:49,840 --> 05:35:51,040
thought if team spirit are taking he's

8661
05:35:51,040 --> 05:35:52,680
doing it again isn't he own Strat

8662
05:35:52,680 --> 05:35:54,280
against you and yeah time lap to the

8663
05:35:54,280 --> 05:35:56,840
base for some datal

8664
05:35:56,840 --> 05:36:00,840
action it's your own x marks the

8665
05:36:00,840 --> 05:36:04,400
spot that is so much burst damage when

8666
05:36:04,400 --> 05:36:06,360
he's got he's got the enchanted quiver

8667
05:36:06,360 --> 05:36:09,320
on top of that this is an insane like

8668
05:36:09,320 --> 05:36:11,280
single hit right it doesn't take much he

8669
05:36:11,280 --> 05:36:13,080
just suuchi and hits you instantly can

8670
05:36:13,080 --> 05:36:14,958
start to run away you're just getting

8671
05:36:14,958 --> 05:36:16,878
chunked this is the strength of Weaver

8672
05:36:16,878 --> 05:36:19,798
right now 15 and two for yoro mea

8673
05:36:19,798 --> 05:36:21,000
looking for his opening gameing

8674
05:36:21,000 --> 05:36:23,400
Gladiators it team's pretty clear they

8675
05:36:23,400 --> 05:36:24,920
can't take an honest fight against team

8676
05:36:24,920 --> 05:36:26,600
TRD anymore they're going to have to

8677
05:36:26,600 --> 05:36:28,360
play around the fountain here as to jump

8678
05:36:28,360 --> 05:36:29,958
forward the dream coil is slowly taking

8679
05:36:29,958 --> 05:36:31,878
them out tofu does manage to live for

8680
05:36:31,878 --> 05:36:35,000
now gets back to the Fountain but team

8681
05:36:35,000 --> 05:36:36,760
spirit they still have more

8682
05:36:36,760 --> 05:36:38,200
opportunities coming the agis is going

8683
05:36:38,200 --> 05:36:39,920
to expire so gaming Gladiators manag to

8684
05:36:39,920 --> 05:36:41,760
weather that storm and it's possible

8685
05:36:41,760 --> 05:36:43,878
that team spirit may decide that it's

8686
05:36:43,878 --> 05:36:46,718
best just to wait for a third ran before

8687
05:36:46,718 --> 05:36:49,558
they end it think yoro is happy to give

8688
05:36:49,558 --> 05:36:51,200
the Aegis up it'll free up another slot

8689
05:36:51,200 --> 05:36:52,718
for him at the rate he's going yeah

8690
05:36:52,718 --> 05:36:55,040
seriously he just wants more damage more

8691
05:36:55,040 --> 05:36:57,280
survivability everything is great for

8692
05:36:57,280 --> 05:36:59,240
him right now the scary part is you can

8693
05:36:59,240 --> 05:37:01,600
still work towards a Tusk a in this game

8694
05:37:01,600 --> 05:37:03,840
I Mir is quite farmed oh yeah you're

8695
05:37:03,840 --> 05:37:04,920
talking about a high ground break

8696
05:37:04,920 --> 05:37:06,120
mechanism they really getting a

8697
05:37:06,120 --> 05:37:07,280
stalemate and need it he's going to kick

8698
05:37:07,280 --> 05:37:09,160
someone out Andor just runs straight

8699
05:37:09,160 --> 05:37:12,200
into them BPS bkb turns around oh man

8700
05:37:12,200 --> 05:37:13,760
that damage is just building up so

8701
05:37:13,760 --> 05:37:15,920
quickly Quinn's got in so is the bear

8702
05:37:15,920 --> 05:37:17,958
Dario battling up against Laurel but the

8703
05:37:17,958 --> 05:37:19,878
big bad boss of the the fight is

8704
05:37:19,878 --> 05:37:22,240
definitely in Toro and once he turns his

8705
05:37:22,240 --> 05:37:26,840
eye on a hero abely over game over for

8706
05:37:26,840 --> 05:37:29,638
this one the team Spirits making

8707
05:37:29,638 --> 05:37:32,240
absolutely no qualms about shutting

8708
05:37:32,240 --> 05:37:35,160
gaming Gladiators out in their own style

8709
05:37:35,160 --> 05:37:39,878
33 minutes and it's done such a onesided

8710
05:37:39,878 --> 05:37:42,400
game one I mean nice lower bracket run

8711
05:37:42,400 --> 05:37:44,280
right welcome to the Grand finals here

8712
05:37:44,280 --> 05:37:45,958
welcome to the ultimate boss of DOTA

8713
05:37:45,958 --> 05:37:47,520
right now as you might have won three

8714
05:37:47,520 --> 05:37:48,638
Majors you might have made it all the

8715
05:37:48,638 --> 05:37:50,638
way here but if you can't find a way to

8716
05:37:50,638 --> 05:37:51,920
break this team which nobody else has

8717
05:37:51,920 --> 05:37:54,400
been able to do you're going to go home

8718
05:37:54,400 --> 05:37:57,558
empty-handed and game gladi like they

8719
05:37:57,558 --> 05:38:00,240
had such a good run leading up to this

8720
05:38:00,240 --> 05:38:02,718
right they lost one game in this playoff

8721
05:38:02,718 --> 05:38:04,400
run of theirs and that was against Team

8722
05:38:04,400 --> 05:38:06,200
Liquid the only team who managed to take

8723
05:38:06,200 --> 05:38:09,280
it until they run into team spirit and

8724
05:38:09,280 --> 05:38:11,080
they they kind of look shook right oh

8725
05:38:11,080 --> 05:38:12,680
yeah that's what they want their

8726
05:38:12,680 --> 05:38:14,160
opponents to feel a 30-minute High

8727
05:38:14,160 --> 05:38:16,558
Ground GG make it look easy just run

8728
05:38:16,558 --> 05:38:18,400
away with the lanes you had a couple

8729
05:38:18,400 --> 05:38:19,760
power runes go Quinn's way but he

8730
05:38:19,760 --> 05:38:20,920
couldn't find anything on these side

8731
05:38:20,920 --> 05:38:22,760
Lanes the mid Clash didn't work the side

8732
05:38:22,760 --> 05:38:25,200
lane pressure mounted way too quickly

8733
05:38:25,200 --> 05:38:26,798
yet ancients to fall back on for

8734
05:38:26,798 --> 05:38:29,040
collapse yoro is just slaying people

8735
05:38:29,040 --> 05:38:31,958
ends this game 18 and two this man's

8736
05:38:31,958 --> 05:38:33,958
just padding his legacy stats at this

8737
05:38:33,958 --> 05:38:36,558
point I mean seriously he's trying to

8738
05:38:36,558 --> 05:38:38,280
make a a name for him himself here as he

8739
05:38:38,280 --> 05:38:40,320
already did once before a TI 10 but if

8740
05:38:40,320 --> 05:38:43,240
he could become a two time alongside his

8741
05:38:43,240 --> 05:38:46,080
team it would be something magical but

8742
05:38:46,080 --> 05:38:47,600
that game one that might have been

8743
05:38:47,600 --> 05:38:49,440
convincing we've seen plenty of

8744
05:38:49,440 --> 05:38:52,558
convincing games in TI it's the best of

8745
05:38:52,558 --> 05:38:54,280
five for a reason right Avery there's

8746
05:38:54,280 --> 05:38:56,240
some changes we can make strategy wise

8747
05:38:56,240 --> 05:38:57,718
in particular what was one thing you

8748
05:38:57,718 --> 05:38:59,600
would point for gaming Gladiators that

8749
05:38:59,600 --> 05:39:01,280
you would like to see heading forward in

8750
05:39:01,280 --> 05:39:02,840
this series I mean you have to think

8751
05:39:02,840 --> 05:39:04,240
about the lanes going a bit better for

8752
05:39:04,240 --> 05:39:05,558
you and how who you're going to play

8753
05:39:05,558 --> 05:39:06,638
around right now because it felt like

8754
05:39:06,638 --> 05:39:08,240
they left Ace on an island for a lot of

8755
05:39:08,240 --> 05:39:10,360
that offline early game and TP just

8756
05:39:10,360 --> 05:39:12,120
abused it especially with this Weaver

8757
05:39:12,120 --> 05:39:13,600
pick it's basically the most aggressive

8758
05:39:13,600 --> 05:39:15,080
carry you give you a Toro start like

8759
05:39:15,080 --> 05:39:16,680
that he's just going to pop off on it

8760
05:39:16,680 --> 05:39:18,120
and never look back he's the best carry

8761
05:39:18,120 --> 05:39:20,638
of the tournament so far showing why

8762
05:39:20,638 --> 05:39:22,478
absolutely showing why in the panel will

8763
05:39:22,478 --> 05:39:24,840
sure be able to talk more about that as

8764
05:39:24,840 --> 05:39:26,478
we head into game

8765
05:39:26,478 --> 05:39:30,478
two thank you very much CVG team spirit

8766
05:39:30,478 --> 05:39:33,160
take game number one here in the ground

8767
05:39:33,160 --> 05:39:35,680
finals of the international

8768
05:39:35,680 --> 05:39:40,360
2023 and it was uh it was almost almost

8769
05:39:40,360 --> 05:39:42,160
as if team spirit just taken a page out

8770
05:39:42,160 --> 05:39:43,840
of gaming gladiator's book and uh

8771
05:39:43,840 --> 05:39:47,160
basically was the oppressor in this game

8772
05:39:47,160 --> 05:39:49,600
I'm joined by F by T but he also had a

8773
05:39:49,600 --> 05:39:51,680
change on the panel as we now have

8774
05:39:51,680 --> 05:39:54,360
insania weighing in for the inside and

8775
05:39:54,360 --> 05:39:57,160
you said this is oppressive game play

8776
05:39:57,160 --> 05:39:59,280
coming out from team spirit here yeah I

8777
05:39:59,280 --> 05:40:00,520
feel like normally when you play against

8778
05:40:00,520 --> 05:40:02,840
Gladiators they tend to Corner you into

8779
05:40:02,840 --> 05:40:04,360
taking a lot of bad fights I'm sure

8780
05:40:04,360 --> 05:40:06,080
anyone that's watched this play like why

8781
05:40:06,080 --> 05:40:07,638
are you guys fighting them like it's so

8782
05:40:07,638 --> 05:40:09,320
obvious you're going to lose this fight

8783
05:40:09,320 --> 05:40:10,760
but I feel like what Spirit did this

8784
05:40:10,760 --> 05:40:11,958
game was they they brought the numbers

8785
05:40:11,958 --> 05:40:13,160
really early on and made sure that

8786
05:40:13,160 --> 05:40:14,680
wasn't going to happen yeah it happened

8787
05:40:14,680 --> 05:40:16,360
at the 9 Minute 50 Mark for me when they

8788
05:40:16,360 --> 05:40:17,840
take this fight bottom miror he holds a

8789
05:40:17,840 --> 05:40:20,200
snowball he kind of baits G to take this

8790
05:40:20,200 --> 05:40:21,600
fight meanwhile Ace is in the mid lane

8791
05:40:21,600 --> 05:40:23,440
playing L like how does he rotate to

8792
05:40:23,440 --> 05:40:24,840
this bot fight and contribute to these

8793
05:40:24,840 --> 05:40:26,400
quick early engagements and that was the

8794
05:40:26,400 --> 05:40:27,520
story of the game for Spirit just

8795
05:40:27,520 --> 05:40:29,280
constantly Dodge take away the fights

8796
05:40:29,280 --> 05:40:31,400
away from LD but also when he's by

8797
05:40:31,400 --> 05:40:33,000
himself trying to recover you K him as

8798
05:40:33,000 --> 05:40:34,360
well he had eight deaths by the 30

8799
05:40:34,360 --> 05:40:35,798
minute mark it was the most times Ace

8800
05:40:35,798 --> 05:40:37,638
has died on Lone DD so far at the

8801
05:40:37,638 --> 05:40:39,000
international he was just completely

8802
05:40:39,000 --> 05:40:41,040
shut down yeah and on the topic of that

8803
05:40:41,040 --> 05:40:43,920
ler that game felt impossible for ler to

8804
05:40:43,920 --> 05:40:47,040
ever recover because I think that Spirit

8805
05:40:47,040 --> 05:40:49,240
had a genius Lane versus lro and that

8806
05:40:49,240 --> 05:40:50,760
came after it that's the interesting

8807
05:40:50,760 --> 05:40:52,400
thing they picked lro after they saw

8808
05:40:52,400 --> 05:40:54,360
Weaver and Tran I mean conceptually when

8809
05:40:54,360 --> 05:40:55,958
you have these very high damage out

8810
05:40:55,958 --> 05:40:57,718
Heroes like Weaver and TR on the lane

8811
05:40:57,718 --> 05:40:59,520
you should be able to kill the bear over

8812
05:40:59,520 --> 05:41:01,120
and over again and that's what happened

8813
05:41:01,120 --> 05:41:02,478
they killed the bear a couple of times

8814
05:41:02,478 --> 05:41:04,360
on Lane they were able to constantly

8815
05:41:04,360 --> 05:41:06,200
pressure and dive the lone Druid and it

8816
05:41:06,200 --> 05:41:07,840
made it so that because that Lane run so

8817
05:41:07,840 --> 05:41:09,798
poorly there was no way for Quinn on the

8818
05:41:09,798 --> 05:41:11,760
Pango to rotate top and correct it in

8819
05:41:11,760 --> 05:41:14,558
any way yeah it was a strong performance

8820
05:41:14,558 --> 05:41:15,840
that it definitely looked like team

8821
05:41:15,840 --> 05:41:17,558
spirit was very well prepared for what

8822
05:41:17,558 --> 05:41:20,360
gaming Gladiators was going to bring to

8823
05:41:20,360 --> 05:41:22,360
the table in the first game of the best

8824
05:41:22,360 --> 05:41:24,718
of five inania you've been against these

8825
05:41:24,718 --> 05:41:27,638
two teams in the grand finals several

8826
05:41:27,638 --> 05:41:31,080
times this year yeah unsuccessfully so

8827
05:41:31,080 --> 05:41:34,000
well what makes these two teams be the

8828
05:41:34,000 --> 05:41:37,638
grand finals raid boss if you will I

8829
05:41:37,638 --> 05:41:39,440
think they they're both teams that have

8830
05:41:39,440 --> 05:41:41,320
pretty strong identities and usually by

8831
05:41:41,320 --> 05:41:42,718
the time that they get to Grand finals

8832
05:41:42,718 --> 05:41:44,200
theyve really figured out what makes

8833
05:41:44,200 --> 05:41:46,920
their identity work so um they're not

8834
05:41:46,920 --> 05:41:47,878
really I would say like the most

8835
05:41:47,878 --> 05:41:49,160
adaptive teams but they're really good

8836
05:41:49,160 --> 05:41:51,040
at figuring out how can we enable

8837
05:41:51,040 --> 05:41:53,040
ourselves to play our own game so it

8838
05:41:53,040 --> 05:41:54,320
wouldn't surprise me if Gladiators you

8839
05:41:54,320 --> 05:41:55,878
know they swap up some Heroes and then

8840
05:41:55,878 --> 05:41:57,718
they go look to do the same thing again

8841
05:41:57,718 --> 05:41:59,080
it's probably going to be a battle of

8842
05:41:59,080 --> 05:42:01,360
like two very specific Styles and if

8843
05:42:01,360 --> 05:42:02,760
Gladiators can take control of the map

8844
05:42:02,760 --> 05:42:05,120
and really like force you into a corner

8845
05:42:05,120 --> 05:42:06,798
then they'll probably be Victorious and

8846
05:42:06,798 --> 05:42:09,320
if is able to like hold that away hold

8847
05:42:09,320 --> 05:42:10,920
the aggression off then I think they'll

8848
05:42:10,920 --> 05:42:12,920
have the edge yeah I feel like as well

8849
05:42:12,920 --> 05:42:13,958
for team spirit they're coming to this

8850
05:42:13,958 --> 05:42:15,638
series they pick Beast Master hear that

8851
05:42:15,638 --> 05:42:16,478
we haven't seen them play at the

8852
05:42:16,478 --> 05:42:18,120
international so far of course they do

8853
05:42:18,120 --> 05:42:19,958
play it multiple times a fall but it's

8854
05:42:19,958 --> 05:42:21,558
the fact that Spirit they look at gaming

8855
05:42:21,558 --> 05:42:22,760
they read them and go you know what

8856
05:42:22,760 --> 05:42:24,440
rather than trying to be defensive let's

8857
05:42:24,440 --> 05:42:26,200
just overwhelm you as well with our own

8858
05:42:26,200 --> 05:42:27,760
level of pressure a lot of teams have

8859
05:42:27,760 --> 05:42:30,320
tried to delay prolong and survive that

8860
05:42:30,320 --> 05:42:32,200
Onslaught but it was refreshing to see

8861
05:42:32,200 --> 05:42:34,160
Spirit just change up the style and go

8862
05:42:34,160 --> 05:42:35,920
no this is how you beat gaming yeah and

8863
05:42:35,920 --> 05:42:37,638
they close out their second pH is with

8864
05:42:37,638 --> 05:42:39,240
that Beast Master right and back when

8865
05:42:39,240 --> 05:42:41,040
Beast Master was very broken that was

8866
05:42:41,040 --> 05:42:43,120
the most difficult part of drafting is

8867
05:42:43,120 --> 05:42:46,160
you very concerned for those Goa 18 pick

8868
05:42:46,160 --> 05:42:47,680
on the Beast Masters or the storm

8869
05:42:47,680 --> 05:42:49,120
spirits and they picked that Beast

8870
05:42:49,120 --> 05:42:50,680
Master when they saw the silencer and

8871
05:42:50,680 --> 05:42:52,600
the MUA two supports that can't do

8872
05:42:52,600 --> 05:42:54,920
anything versus the zoo So Not only was

8873
05:42:54,920 --> 05:42:57,240
that pick genius but I really feel that

8874
05:42:57,240 --> 05:42:58,558
having this Weaver in the first phase

8875
05:42:58,558 --> 05:43:00,478
for yoro is going to be something to

8876
05:43:00,478 --> 05:43:02,360
look out for in the series because if

8877
05:43:02,360 --> 05:43:03,798
they can bring the aggression to G

8878
05:43:03,798 --> 05:43:06,120
Gladiators from their safe Lane early on

8879
05:43:06,120 --> 05:43:08,280
G might not be able to ever play for the

8880
05:43:08,280 --> 05:43:09,718
tempo that they're looking for yeah we

8881
05:43:09,718 --> 05:43:11,080
mentioned that the off laners were going

8882
05:43:11,080 --> 05:43:13,600
to play a big role here today uh inia I

8883
05:43:13,600 --> 05:43:14,520
don't know if you've noticed that as

8884
05:43:14,520 --> 05:43:16,160
well I mean for us on the panel we talk

8885
05:43:16,160 --> 05:43:18,600
about the the the best looking stats if

8886
05:43:18,600 --> 05:43:20,080
that makes sense and it's been very

8887
05:43:20,080 --> 05:43:23,080
often this International the off laner

8888
05:43:23,080 --> 05:43:26,718
why is that yeah I mean I think um so I

8889
05:43:26,718 --> 05:43:27,760
feel like there's been like multiple

8890
05:43:27,760 --> 05:43:29,680
metas like the group stage it was one

8891
05:43:29,680 --> 05:43:31,798
meta now it's another but the the off

8892
05:43:31,798 --> 05:43:33,200
Lanes seem to be like the general place

8893
05:43:33,200 --> 05:43:34,840
where you get a lot of pressure and with

8894
05:43:34,840 --> 05:43:36,320
how the portals Now work on the map

8895
05:43:36,320 --> 05:43:38,000
where you can like kind of portal around

8896
05:43:38,000 --> 05:43:40,320
and you can want one lane to go to the

8897
05:43:40,320 --> 05:43:41,680
off Lane seems to be like the easier

8898
05:43:41,680 --> 05:43:43,200
place to connect to and then like get

8899
05:43:43,200 --> 05:43:45,958
that thing going so having strong off

8900
05:43:45,958 --> 05:43:47,920
Lanes sets up for like your position

8901
05:43:47,920 --> 05:43:49,400
five to rotate and like everybody to

8902
05:43:49,400 --> 05:43:51,120
come in and create a lot of pressure and

8903
05:43:51,120 --> 05:43:53,958
both these teams are very like offlane

8904
05:43:53,958 --> 05:43:55,718
uh heavy teams you know like collaps and

8905
05:43:55,718 --> 05:43:58,600
Ace they're yeah two star players for

8906
05:43:58,600 --> 05:44:00,360
these teams very much so and we heard

8907
05:44:00,360 --> 05:44:02,120
our draft penel at the end there as well

8908
05:44:02,120 --> 05:44:03,280
at the end of the draft they mentioned

8909
05:44:03,280 --> 05:44:04,840
how important that Top Lane was going to

8910
05:44:04,840 --> 05:44:08,000
be and I think that's where we saw the

8911
05:44:08,000 --> 05:44:10,520
Weaver just pop off yoro had a fantastic

8912
05:44:10,520 --> 05:44:12,320
game yeah there is nothing really to

8913
05:44:12,320 --> 05:44:14,160
stop that we Weaver like I mentioned

8914
05:44:14,160 --> 05:44:15,798
before and pairing it up with the Triant

8915
05:44:15,798 --> 05:44:17,558
made it so that Not only was it a strong

8916
05:44:17,558 --> 05:44:20,040
kill threat Lane but it worked perfectly

8917
05:44:20,040 --> 05:44:21,478
in playing against the lone Droid that

8918
05:44:21,478 --> 05:44:23,360
they didn't even have to prepare for or

8919
05:44:23,360 --> 05:44:25,440
think about or maybe they did it in the

8920
05:44:25,440 --> 05:44:27,760
preparation knowing that lro might be

8921
05:44:27,760 --> 05:44:29,280
run by Gan because of their Series

8922
05:44:29,280 --> 05:44:31,400
yesterday but if lro can't have a good

8923
05:44:31,400 --> 05:44:33,080
start in the lane and his mid laner

8924
05:44:33,080 --> 05:44:35,120
cannot enable him by maybe getting some

8925
05:44:35,120 --> 05:44:37,280
cleanup kills after he's fed a couple of

8926
05:44:37,280 --> 05:44:39,000
bears then where do you go from there

8927
05:44:39,000 --> 05:44:40,798
because T was mentioning there's no way

8928
05:44:40,798 --> 05:44:42,840
for ler to rotate bottom when there's a

8929
05:44:42,840 --> 05:44:44,400
team fight going on he's too busy

8930
05:44:44,400 --> 05:44:46,478
recovering in the mid lane yeah and

8931
05:44:46,478 --> 05:44:48,478
recover gaming Gladiators never really

8932
05:44:48,478 --> 05:44:50,798
did do that so they're now one game down

8933
05:44:50,798 --> 05:44:52,360
in a best of five grand finals they have

8934
05:44:52,360 --> 05:44:54,240
some time to reset and while they do

8935
05:44:54,240 --> 05:44:56,760

something's lacking with the squad

8998
05:47:54,320 --> 05:47:56,080
little bit we had this last year you

8999
05:47:56,080 --> 05:47:59,000

9000
05:47:59,000 --> 05:48:01,520
atti I will shave my head William looked

9001
05:48:01,520 --> 05:48:03,400
us in our eyes and said I promise you

9002
05:48:03,400 --> 05:48:05,478
guys if we get to four I will shave my

9003
05:48:05,478 --> 05:48:08,080
head yeah so we top four and then we're

9004
05:48:08,080 --> 05:48:09,360
like all right William you know we got

9005
05:48:09,360 --> 05:48:11,558
four days where is it let's shave it and

9006
05:48:11,558 --> 05:48:12,958
he's like no no no no no I said top

9007
05:48:12,958 --> 05:48:15,160
three but we had Vlog footage so we went

9008
05:48:15,160 --> 05:48:17,040
back and watched the Vlog and it's very

9009
05:48:17,040 --> 05:48:19,638
clearly top four but you guys also got

9010
05:48:19,638 --> 05:48:21,000
top three and then we got top three and

9011
05:48:21,000 --> 05:48:22,760
we're like William shave your head and

9012
05:48:22,760 --> 05:48:25,520
he's like you know like he William's out

9013
05:48:25,520 --> 05:48:28,360
of it and then uh yeah no shaving your

9014
05:48:28,360 --> 05:48:29,798
head I think probably would have is the

9015
05:48:29,798 --> 05:48:31,638
reason we didn't do better at this yeah

9016
05:48:31,638 --> 05:48:33,840
I mean next year there's always a chance

9017
05:48:33,840 --> 05:48:35,558
so maybe you know there's a 15minute

9018
05:48:35,558 --> 05:48:37,000
break in the the meantime Maybe ging

9019
05:48:37,000 --> 05:48:39,160
Gladiators is finding a razor as we

9020
05:48:39,160 --> 05:48:43,080
speak for their head that is

9021
05:48:43,080 --> 05:48:45,840
and that was very Grim that's not why I

9022
05:48:45,840 --> 05:48:47,840
wanted to go with that what I do want to

9023
05:48:47,840 --> 05:48:50,120
say isan we've got some very dat vated

9024
05:48:50,120 --> 05:48:53,600
FS I am sure that if slack push it that

9025
05:48:53,600 --> 05:48:55,040
uh there would have been a bald head

9026
05:48:55,040 --> 05:48:56,680
behind us and while they we have very

9027
05:48:56,680 --> 05:48:59,760

you are also with Spirit as we saw a lot

9033
05:49:14,040 --> 05:49:16,200
of Cheers there where team spirit take

9034
05:49:16,200 --> 05:49:18,360
the first game of this best of five

9035
05:49:18,360 --> 05:49:20,160
grand finals and we we got to talk about

9036
05:49:20,160 --> 05:49:22,200
adaptations because it's a best of five

9037
05:49:22,200 --> 05:49:23,478
both of these teams have been here

9038
05:49:23,478 --> 05:49:25,440
before both of these teams have shown

9039
05:49:25,440 --> 05:49:26,920
that they have what it takes to be able

9040
05:49:26,920 --> 05:49:29,680
to adapt on the fly in the break that

9041
05:49:29,680 --> 05:49:32,840
they get the question is where are they

9042
05:49:32,840 --> 05:49:34,400
going to go with the adaptations I have

9043
05:49:34,400 --> 05:49:36,080
to address a little bit it's not really

9044
05:49:36,080 --> 05:49:37,958
an elephant it's more like horse size in

9045
05:49:37,958 --> 05:49:40,000
the room I want to talk about the gyro

9046
05:49:40,000 --> 05:49:41,878
copter that came out as the overall last

9047
05:49:41,878 --> 05:49:44,440
pick e it's not a hero that we've seen

9048
05:49:44,440 --> 05:49:47,160
do very well or has been very popular

9049
05:49:47,160 --> 05:49:50,520
over these last few weeks why why was

9050
05:49:50,520 --> 05:49:51,878
this attempted and why didn't it work

9051
05:49:51,878 --> 05:49:53,760
out I mean it was just a response to the

9052
05:49:53,760 --> 05:49:55,558
Beast Master right it's like at that

9053
05:49:55,558 --> 05:49:56,878
point what do you do you're playing

9054
05:49:56,878 --> 05:49:58,320
against a summons hero you don't have

9055
05:49:58,320 --> 05:50:00,040
anything to address it your pangali is

9056
05:50:00,040 --> 05:50:01,360
going to be a little bit busy because

9057
05:50:01,360 --> 05:50:03,040
he's playing against the puck Pango

9058
05:50:03,040 --> 05:50:05,320
alone isn't enough you go for gyro who's

9059
05:50:05,320 --> 05:50:07,558
typically the AOE clear type of carry

9060
05:50:07,558 --> 05:50:09,280
but in this her fell out of meta for

9061
05:50:09,280 --> 05:50:11,160
many reasons I feel like he plays a

9062
05:50:11,160 --> 05:50:13,080
little bit too slowly if the aggression

9063
05:50:13,080 --> 05:50:14,600
is brought to you in the way team spirit

9064
05:50:14,600 --> 05:50:16,680
brought it with that Weaver gyro does

9065
05:50:16,680 --> 05:50:18,600
not have enough time to respond to that

9066
05:50:18,600 --> 05:50:20,520
he needs to sit in his entrance needs to

9067
05:50:20,520 --> 05:50:22,680
farm up like two or three items and they

9068
05:50:22,680 --> 05:50:24,320
couldn't reach that point yeah I feel

9069
05:50:24,320 --> 05:50:25,600
like maybe the main question for me is

9070
05:50:25,600 --> 05:50:27,160
going to be lered I don't think gaming

9071
05:50:27,160 --> 05:50:29,000
will pick it so openly now knowing that

9072
05:50:29,000 --> 05:50:30,160
Spirit are going to be able to play such

9073
05:50:30,160 --> 05:50:32,200
a high Pace game kind of abuse the fact

9074
05:50:32,200 --> 05:50:33,600
that he's on one side of the map you can

9075
05:50:33,600 --> 05:50:35,600
only bring four and then on top of that

9076
05:50:35,600 --> 05:50:36,878
like e was mentioning if you have a jar

9077
05:50:36,878 --> 05:50:38,200
copter as well who also wants to hit

9078
05:50:38,200 --> 05:50:40,440
ancients like lenid wants a lane jar

9079
05:50:40,440 --> 05:50:42,280
wants ancients what three hero is going

9080
05:50:42,280 --> 05:50:43,558
to do everything else for you so I think

9081
05:50:43,558 --> 05:50:45,520
for gaming LD that's going to be the big

9082
05:50:45,520 --> 05:50:46,878
question mark for me maybe they pick it

9083
05:50:46,878 --> 05:50:49,160
on like 18 or kind of a closing part of

9084
05:50:49,160 --> 05:50:50,680
the phase rather than so openly yeah

9085
05:50:50,680 --> 05:50:52,718
with LD alone drew it there indeed the

9086
05:50:52,718 --> 05:50:54,360
offliner for Ace didn't have didn't have

9087
05:50:54,360 --> 05:50:57,360
a great game and overall it felt like

9088
05:50:57,360 --> 05:51:00,080
then the the plan insania that gaming

9089
05:51:00,080 --> 05:51:02,600
Gladiators had it was very different

9090
05:51:02,600 --> 05:51:04,638
from the style that we've seen them play

9091
05:51:04,638 --> 05:51:06,840
because if they are playing for the

9092
05:51:06,840 --> 05:51:08,320
later stages of the game they're not

9093
05:51:08,320 --> 05:51:10,400
going to be able to do their aggression

9094
05:51:10,400 --> 05:51:12,440
ball that we've seen them be very

9095
05:51:12,440 --> 05:51:14,200
dominant with I think the idea was to

9096
05:51:14,200 --> 05:51:15,718
try to set up like the same thing where

9097
05:51:15,718 --> 05:51:17,840
they have the SL and amera do very well

9098
05:51:17,840 --> 05:51:18,920
on the off lane and then you know we

9099
05:51:18,920 --> 05:51:20,718
have tofu running mid we call it

9100
05:51:20,718 --> 05:51:22,040
cringing in our team it's like when the

9101
05:51:22,040 --> 05:51:23,958
two supports show up mid and they just

9102
05:51:23,958 --> 05:51:26,240
cringe the mid laner um so I think they

9103
05:51:26,240 --> 05:51:27,760
wanted to cringe Laurel you know make

9104
05:51:27,760 --> 05:51:30,440
sure his game is terrible but it kind of

9105
05:51:30,440 --> 05:51:32,280
uh relies on the laning phase going well

9106
05:51:32,280 --> 05:51:33,600
and I think the gyro copter in many ways

9107
05:51:33,600 --> 05:51:36,000
is picked to enable that you want the

9108
05:51:36,000 --> 05:51:37,638
safe Lane to be strong you just want the

9109
05:51:37,638 --> 05:51:39,638
lane to go well to free up Celery free

9110
05:51:39,638 --> 05:51:41,840
up uh tofu to then go pressure mid lane

9111
05:51:41,840 --> 05:51:43,320
and enable Quinn to then you know get

9112
05:51:43,320 --> 05:51:45,200
the ball rolling but in this game it

9113
05:51:45,200 --> 05:51:46,558
just I don't think the lanes really

9114
05:51:46,558 --> 05:51:48,280
played out the way they expected them to

9115
05:51:48,280 --> 05:51:49,798
no I do I do think we should mention the

9116
05:51:49,798 --> 05:51:51,000
mid lane a little bit because we've

9117
05:51:51,000 --> 05:51:52,958
talked a lot about Pango this entire

9118
05:51:52,958 --> 05:51:56,638
weekend and this entire event so far in

9119
05:51:56,638 --> 05:51:58,440
other people's hands other than Quinn

9120
05:51:58,440 --> 05:52:00,360
the hero has not looked great overall

9121
05:52:00,360 --> 05:52:02,200
he's had a fantastic win rate with it

9122
05:52:02,200 --> 05:52:04,520
this time around TV this game though he

9123
05:52:04,520 --> 05:52:07,160
wasn't able to get the ball rolling

9124
05:52:07,160 --> 05:52:09,280
yeah no he he kind of fell flat thank

9125
05:52:09,280 --> 05:52:11,840
you thank thank you audible sigh um but

9126
05:52:11,840 --> 05:52:13,520
no I think the early game for Quinn he

9127
05:52:13,520 --> 05:52:14,920
was able to make a couple of those moves

9128
05:52:14,920 --> 05:52:16,120
he was punishing the supports from

9129
05:52:16,120 --> 05:52:17,600
Spirit but then it got to the point

9130
05:52:17,600 --> 05:52:19,400
where he was making so many rotations

9131
05:52:19,400 --> 05:52:21,760
that eventually Spirit knew which one to

9132
05:52:21,760 --> 05:52:23,798
capitalize on which one to punish so I

9133
05:52:23,798 --> 05:52:25,718
think we they shouldn't be deterred from

9134
05:52:25,718 --> 05:52:27,240
picking this hero it is a matter of

9135
05:52:27,240 --> 05:52:28,600
there so many other factors laying into

9136
05:52:28,600 --> 05:52:30,520
it but yeah the Quinn panglea it's

9137
05:52:30,520 --> 05:52:31,680
probably a hero that he would want to

9138
05:52:31,680 --> 05:52:33,240
play a couple more times if he's going

9139
05:52:33,240 --> 05:52:35,478
to try and secure this uh this AIS I

9140
05:52:35,478 --> 05:52:37,320
mean the issue was he couldn't rotate on

9141
05:52:37,320 --> 05:52:39,120
the lane that he needed to rotate which

9142
05:52:39,120 --> 05:52:40,400
was the Weaver Lane right if he's

9143
05:52:40,400 --> 05:52:42,280
consistently putting all of his efforts

9144
05:52:42,280 --> 05:52:43,798
in playing on the Beast Master Lane

9145
05:52:43,798 --> 05:52:45,280
you're not really solving the Crux of

9146
05:52:45,280 --> 05:52:47,080
the problem because even if you can get

9147
05:52:47,080 --> 05:52:48,440
a couple of kills on that lane Beast

9148
05:52:48,440 --> 05:52:49,600
Master is just going to sit in the

9149
05:52:49,600 --> 05:52:51,320
jungle and farm for a little bit while

9150
05:52:51,320 --> 05:52:53,240
the Weaver is playing a supremely

9151
05:52:53,240 --> 05:52:54,840
aggressive game versus your lone Dr and

9152
05:52:54,840 --> 05:52:57,718
not allowing him to come back but when

9153
05:52:57,718 --> 05:52:59,040
Quinn has looked good with the Pango

9154
05:52:59,040 --> 05:53:00,520
this tournament it's usually come out

9155
05:53:00,520 --> 05:53:02,760
later in the draft right yesterday they

9156
05:53:02,760 --> 05:53:04,200
had it close out their second phase

9157
05:53:04,200 --> 05:53:05,680
versus azer Ray when they saw the

9158
05:53:05,680 --> 05:53:07,040
enchantress in the

9159
05:53:07,040 --> 05:53:08,680
and it looked great there today they

9160
05:53:08,680 --> 05:53:10,840
brought it out after the Weaver and is

9161
05:53:10,840 --> 05:53:12,638
seeing a weaver enough to pick a pangier

9162
05:53:12,638 --> 05:53:14,878
that early I don't think so I also like

9163
05:53:14,878 --> 05:53:16,478
the fact that they picked so on the on

9164
05:53:16,478 --> 05:53:17,920
the flip side with the Weaver you have a

9165
05:53:17,920 --> 05:53:19,840
Tusk and a tree so when things are going

9166
05:53:19,840 --> 05:53:22,240
kind of chaotic whatever of these melee

9167
05:53:22,240 --> 05:53:23,320
Heroes wants to go to the weav it's

9168
05:53:23,320 --> 05:53:24,558
going to be a kill Lane right it's like

9169
05:53:24,558 --> 05:53:26,478
you can use that twin gate get a kill so

9170
05:53:26,478 --> 05:53:29,558
it's a bit difficult for that it's a bit

9171
05:53:29,558 --> 05:53:31,280
difficult indeed and you see a lot of

9172
05:53:31,280 --> 05:53:33,478
thoughtful faces there for gaming

9173
05:53:33,478 --> 05:53:36,040
Gladiators and uh we have a lot of data

9174
05:53:36,040 --> 05:53:37,878
on them they've played a lot of games

9175
05:53:37,878 --> 05:53:40,320
the most games played here at the

9176
05:53:40,320 --> 05:53:41,638
international making it all the way

9177
05:53:41,638 --> 05:53:43,440
through a full best of three lower

9178
05:53:43,440 --> 05:53:46,360
bracket means that team spirit has a lot

9179
05:53:46,360 --> 05:53:48,718
of data to go off of as well insia how

9180
05:53:48,718 --> 05:53:51,478
much in a best of five do you really put

9181
05:53:51,478 --> 05:53:54,400
stock into the game that has been played

9182
05:53:54,400 --> 05:53:56,200
um not just today this morning but

9183
05:53:56,200 --> 05:53:57,600
throughout the entire tournament because

9184
05:53:57,600 --> 05:53:59,718
I know a best of five generally also has

9185
05:53:59,718 --> 05:54:02,558
like its own meta developing yeah I mean

9186
05:54:02,558 --> 05:54:03,680
usually what's going to end up happening

9187
05:54:03,680 --> 05:54:05,440
is you kind of get a good understanding

9188
05:54:05,440 --> 05:54:06,680
for what it is the other team trying to

9189
05:54:06,680 --> 05:54:09,200
accomplish in the draft and then how to

9190
05:54:09,200 --> 05:54:11,160
adjust to it is usually the at least for

9191
05:54:11,160 --> 05:54:12,478
us I think it's been a trickier part

9192
05:54:12,478 --> 05:54:15,200
Delta year so um yeah you definitely

9193
05:54:15,200 --> 05:54:16,840
like develop your own meta you kind of

9194
05:54:16,840 --> 05:54:18,320
like usually game one is like a feel

9195
05:54:18,320 --> 05:54:20,360
your opponent out kind of game and you

9196
05:54:20,360 --> 05:54:22,160
get understanding of like this is the

9197
05:54:22,160 --> 05:54:23,520
idea I had prepared this is the idea you

9198
05:54:23,520 --> 05:54:25,638
had prepared how do these two Clash so

9199
05:54:25,638 --> 05:54:27,320
now Gladiators kind of have to you know

9200
05:54:27,320 --> 05:54:28,958
show their hand they have to kind of mix

9201
05:54:28,958 --> 05:54:30,878
something up probably won't be seeing

9202
05:54:30,878 --> 05:54:32,360
gyro again might see some adjustments to

9203
05:54:32,360 --> 05:54:33,440
the bands so they don't feel like

9204
05:54:33,440 --> 05:54:35,000
they're in a position where they need to

9205
05:54:35,000 --> 05:54:37,280
force the gyro

9206
05:54:37,280 --> 05:54:40,200
um yeah as a gyro Enthusiast myself I

9207
05:54:40,200 --> 05:54:41,638
don't mind seeing the hero it's nice do

9208
05:54:41,638 --> 05:54:43,320
you think they misclick this one or no I

9209
05:54:43,320 --> 05:54:45,280
think they wanted it okay yeah would you

9210
05:54:45,280 --> 05:54:48,400
have chosen the same cosmetic H I don't

9211
05:54:48,400 --> 05:54:49,920
I'm not really sure what gyro Cosmetics

9212
05:54:49,920 --> 05:54:52,120
he had the the Cosmetic that he had was

9213
05:54:52,120 --> 05:54:55,000
the one that makes FL Cannon incredibly

9214
05:54:55,000 --> 05:54:58,040
visible like it was disco show out there

9215
05:54:58,040 --> 05:54:59,520
yeah that's a good

9216
05:54:59,520 --> 05:55:03,040
one all right awesome why not but I I am

9217
05:55:03,040 --> 05:55:04,520
actually curious aen so when we're

9218
05:55:04,520 --> 05:55:06,080
talking about this pangier coming out

9219
05:55:06,080 --> 05:55:08,878
early and when when it doesn't look good

9220
05:55:08,878 --> 05:55:11,040
how much stock did you guys put into

9221
05:55:11,040 --> 05:55:12,478
thinking about this pengle because

9222
05:55:12,478 --> 05:55:13,878
obviously you're going to consider it it

9223
05:55:13,878 --> 05:55:15,958
is gaming gladiators but you did let it

9224
05:55:15,958 --> 05:55:17,718
through a few times I think we've been

9225
05:55:17,718 --> 05:55:20,200
letting it through all year long um I

9226
05:55:20,200 --> 05:55:22,000
remember I had a I had a conversation

9227
05:55:22,000 --> 05:55:23,240
with I think thundra at some point and

9228
05:55:23,240 --> 05:55:24,718
they were like just bam Pango and you

9229
05:55:24,718 --> 05:55:27,000
win against Quinn uh but it's like the

9230
05:55:27,000 --> 05:55:28,360
hero doesn't feel that good so when you

9231
05:55:28,360 --> 05:55:29,718
play it yourself and like it doesn't

9232
05:55:29,718 --> 05:55:31,440
seem to work you're kind of surprised

9233
05:55:31,440 --> 05:55:32,440
cuz every time you play against it

9234
05:55:32,440 --> 05:55:33,600
you're like oh this is you know free

9235
05:55:33,600 --> 05:55:35,878
Lane for Nisha and then somehow like he

9236
05:55:35,878 --> 05:55:37,840
makes it makes magic happen but I think

9237
05:55:37,840 --> 05:55:39,520
the point about the Weaver is true like

9238
05:55:39,520 --> 05:55:40,878
it's very difficult for Pango to like

9239
05:55:40,878 --> 05:55:42,638
run to Weaver's Lane roll up and then

9240
05:55:42,638 --> 05:55:44,958
look to do something and then that I

9241
05:55:44,958 --> 05:55:45,958
feel like every time they make the

9242
05:55:45,958 --> 05:55:47,558
pengle work usually they manage to bring

9243
05:55:47,558 --> 05:55:49,120
the to sports mid Snowball the game and

9244
05:55:49,120 --> 05:55:50,240
then like you're scared on both Sid

9245
05:55:50,240 --> 05:55:52,120
Lanes well we're going to find out what

9246
05:55:52,120 --> 05:55:53,840
is happening in game number two as the

9247
05:55:53,840 --> 05:55:55,718
draft for it is right around the corner

9248
05:55:55,718 --> 05:55:57,798
climate pledge Arena DOTA FS around the

9249
05:55:57,798 --> 05:56:00,680
world get

9250
05:56:00,680 --> 05:56:07,840
ready team spirit versus game in

9251
05:56:07,840 --> 05:56:10,280
Gladiators Grand

9252
05:56:10,280 --> 05:56:13,280
Finals game

9253
05:56:13,280 --> 05:56:15,320
two welcome back to the draft panel

9254
05:56:15,320 --> 05:56:16,638
everybody this is going to be game

9255
05:56:16,638 --> 05:56:18,478
number two between spirit and gaming

9256
05:56:18,478 --> 05:56:20,360
Gladiators game one team spirit kind of

9257
05:56:20,360 --> 05:56:22,360
ran them over I think is fair to say so

9258
05:56:22,360 --> 05:56:24,840
that begs the question you know the

9259
05:56:24,840 --> 05:56:26,240
teams are feeling each other out it's a

9260
05:56:26,240 --> 05:56:28,558
best of five what is the adjustment

9261
05:56:28,558 --> 05:56:30,120
going to be for gaming I what would you

9262
05:56:30,120 --> 05:56:32,080
like to see them do first honestly I

9263
05:56:32,080 --> 05:56:33,840
would really like them to not Target

9264
05:56:33,840 --> 05:56:35,440
collapse as much in the bands I think

9265
05:56:35,440 --> 05:56:36,520
that they should play more to the

9266
05:56:36,520 --> 05:56:38,080
strengths then what I felt was like a

9267
05:56:38,080 --> 05:56:39,920
little bit of fear of the opponent I

9268
05:56:39,920 --> 05:56:41,760
feel like the Magnus man was maybe a bit

9269
05:56:41,760 --> 05:56:43,200
overboard I'm not too sure maybe it have

9270
05:56:43,200 --> 05:56:45,040
some scrim experience ver or something

9271
05:56:45,040 --> 05:56:46,280
but I think gaming strength has always

9272
05:56:46,280 --> 05:56:47,958
been playing through Quinn in the mid

9273
05:56:47,958 --> 05:56:49,558
lane and the way that you have to do

9274
05:56:49,558 --> 05:56:51,040
that is that you need stronger s lane

9275
05:56:51,040 --> 05:56:52,878
supports they target their band towards

9276
05:56:52,878 --> 05:56:54,840
maybe a bit of L maybe a bit of the

9277
05:56:54,840 --> 05:56:56,240
spirit safe Lane I think they were to

9278
05:56:56,240 --> 05:56:58,280
rotate on Mid a lot

9279
05:56:58,280 --> 05:57:01,200
easier uh to me it looked actually

9280
05:57:01,200 --> 05:57:02,840
pretty decent at the beginning for

9281
05:57:02,840 --> 05:57:04,760
gaming Gladiators like lanes were not

9282
05:57:04,760 --> 05:57:07,360
that bad and as soon as Spirits start

9283
05:57:07,360 --> 05:57:09,440
rotating super hard like and being super

9284
05:57:09,440 --> 05:57:11,760
active especially on car Weaver like

9285
05:57:11,760 --> 05:57:14,320
this 10 minute rotation like kind of

9286
05:57:14,320 --> 05:57:15,760
break the game apart for gaming

9287
05:57:15,760 --> 05:57:18,400
Gladiators at that point maybe we were

9288
05:57:18,400 --> 05:57:21,040
uh we should have not reacted to that at

9289
05:57:21,040 --> 05:57:22,840
some point or ignore something and find

9290
05:57:22,840 --> 05:57:25,400
a better like fight a bit later on like

9291
05:57:25,400 --> 05:57:29,240
so we don't lose the phase of game yeah

9292
05:57:29,240 --> 05:57:31,080
yeah I think my theory so far of like

9293
05:57:31,080 --> 05:57:32,920
what team spirit's trying to do looks

9294
05:57:32,920 --> 05:57:34,520
true with these bands like they don't

9295
05:57:34,520 --> 05:57:36,718
want Daio to play CK they don't want him

9296
05:57:36,718 --> 05:57:38,280
to play Weaver he has played other

9297
05:57:38,280 --> 05:57:40,040
Heroes like Alchemist Razer but those

9298
05:57:40,040 --> 05:57:42,120
are much later picks and if they are on

9299
05:57:42,120 --> 05:57:43,798
the first pick by the way gaming gliders

9300
05:57:43,798 --> 05:57:45,558
they chose first pick this game so they

9301
05:57:45,558 --> 05:57:47,440
wanted to change just the draft order up

9302
05:57:47,440 --> 05:57:49,280
just a little bit here and it's pretty

9303
05:57:49,280 --> 05:57:51,440
clear yoro is going to be like I will

9304
05:57:51,440 --> 05:57:53,200
take these away from you these Heroes I

9305
05:57:53,200 --> 05:57:54,718
don't play a lot of them but I'll play

9306
05:57:54,718 --> 05:57:55,840
them I'll play them just as good as you

9307
05:57:55,840 --> 05:57:57,600
if not better which is getting into your

9308
05:57:57,600 --> 05:57:59,120
head for sure but now you're in a

9309
05:57:59,120 --> 05:58:01,000
situation where drao he's been playing a

9310
05:58:01,000 --> 05:58:03,160
bunch of Weaver a bunch of CK and then

9311
05:58:03,160 --> 05:58:05,200
later on the draft this Al gets banned

9312
05:58:05,200 --> 05:58:06,638
it has to be a perfect razor game I

9313
05:58:06,638 --> 05:58:08,638
think datu's Hero's been very key for

9314
05:58:08,638 --> 05:58:10,440
gaming Gladiator success here and team

9315
05:58:10,440 --> 05:58:12,360
spirit is really focusing it down this

9316
05:58:12,360 --> 05:58:13,638
opening pick from gaming Gladiators

9317
05:58:13,638 --> 05:58:15,160
we've seen quite a lot it's been respect

9318
05:58:15,160 --> 05:58:16,638
banned against them a ton of games in

9319
05:58:16,638 --> 05:58:18,200
this tournament but obviously at some

9320
05:58:18,200 --> 05:58:20,400
point it will make its way through uh

9321
05:58:20,400 --> 05:58:21,558
this is not the first time they get to

9322
05:58:21,558 --> 05:58:23,878
play it on the main stage and you know

9323
05:58:23,878 --> 05:58:25,280
that's that's usually what happens when

9324
05:58:25,280 --> 05:58:26,360
teams get all the way to the Grand

9325
05:58:26,360 --> 05:58:27,760
finals is they just have so many good

9326
05:58:27,760 --> 05:58:29,200
strategies that you pick your poison

9327
05:58:29,200 --> 05:58:30,600
right and you see here Ace with a three

9328
05:58:30,600 --> 05:58:32,680
in one score line on the Primal beast

9329
05:58:32,680 --> 05:58:34,240
and you know Spirit probably feeling

9330
05:58:34,240 --> 05:58:36,718
pretty good about breaking his zero loss

9331
05:58:36,718 --> 05:58:38,360
streak on the lry it was four on0 before

9332
05:58:38,360 --> 05:58:40,240
the last game uh they took that one out

9333
05:58:40,240 --> 05:58:41,760
now it's time to take out arguably maybe

9334
05:58:41,760 --> 05:58:43,440
his second best hero of the tournament

9335
05:58:43,440 --> 05:58:44,520
yeah I think that just speaks of

9336
05:58:44,520 --> 05:58:46,000
confidence of team spirit I think last

9337
05:58:46,000 --> 05:58:47,558
game they left the pangular in they left

9338
05:58:47,558 --> 05:58:49,798
the lone in they will have something

9339
05:58:49,798 --> 05:58:51,280
prepared for each of the heroes

9340
05:58:51,280 --> 05:58:53,040
something to know is like they've sort

9341
05:58:53,040 --> 05:58:54,160
of been chilling for a bit you know they

9342
05:58:54,160 --> 05:58:56,080
get to watch gladers play a lot of games

9343
05:58:56,080 --> 05:58:56,958
they're going to have the time to

9344
05:58:56,958 --> 05:58:58,360
develop a counter trat for each one of

9345
05:58:58,360 --> 05:59:00,240
these picks I think what Fier said was

9346
05:59:00,240 --> 05:59:01,958
right on the mark like making sure that

9347
05:59:01,958 --> 05:59:03,320
daa doesn't play these aggressive

9348
05:59:03,320 --> 05:59:05,240
carries and keeping off the Weaver and

9349
05:59:05,240 --> 05:59:07,240
CK it looks really good for so I think

9350
05:59:07,240 --> 05:59:08,760
they'll continue to want to do the same

9351
05:59:08,760 --> 05:59:10,478
line of thought like just make sure that

9352
05:59:10,478 --> 05:59:14,520
your dur game's a bit so slow down

9353
05:59:14,520 --> 05:59:17,000
ooh and this was definitely a change

9354
05:59:17,000 --> 05:59:19,160
that they made in the draft they decided

9355
05:59:19,160 --> 05:59:20,878
to collaps Magnus will let it through

9356
05:59:20,878 --> 05:59:23,360
they played it only one single time at

9357
05:59:23,360 --> 05:59:24,718
this TI and that was in their last

9358
05:59:24,718 --> 05:59:26,760
series and collaps was an absolute

9359
05:59:26,760 --> 05:59:28,638
madman in that series doing what he was

9360
05:59:28,638 --> 05:59:30,080
doing at TI 10 just getting all the

9361
05:59:30,080 --> 05:59:31,958
skewers in the world here he didn't have

9362
05:59:31,958 --> 05:59:33,920
the strongest early game and I think if

9363
05:59:33,920 --> 05:59:36,320
you do put this in the off Lane I

9364
05:59:36,320 --> 05:59:37,478
correct me if I'm wrong probably not the

9365
05:59:37,478 --> 05:59:38,798
strongest off laner right now with the

9366
05:59:38,798 --> 05:59:40,400
way he builds but they played with a

9367
05:59:40,400 --> 05:59:42,000
Shadow Demon last time they just got a

9368
05:59:42,000 --> 05:59:43,558
lot of stacks up so maybe we can look

9369
05:59:43,558 --> 05:59:45,520
for them to ban out the Shadow Demon so

9370
05:59:45,520 --> 05:59:47,160
mag doesn't have that recovery option

9371
05:59:47,160 --> 05:59:48,798
yeah Shadow Demon is one of the best

9372
05:59:48,798 --> 05:59:51,600
heroes to counter Primal B Primal Primal

9373
05:59:51,600 --> 05:59:53,360
also is like it's countering him on all

9374
05:59:53,360 --> 05:59:55,558
stages of a game like it doesn't let him

9375
05:59:55,558 --> 05:59:58,520
get STS it's canceling his ulti you can

9376
05:59:58,520 --> 06:00:00,360
hide him when he get BB you hide your

9377
06:00:00,360 --> 06:00:02,680
teammate It's actually an amazing uh

9378
06:00:02,680 --> 06:00:04,798
hero against this I think it's probably

9379
06:00:04,798 --> 06:00:07,080
one of the best support counters to

9380
06:00:07,080 --> 06:00:10,240
Primal is there anything else you think

9381
06:00:10,240 --> 06:00:12,600
gaming are debating here that could be

9382
06:00:12,600 --> 06:00:14,478
an even more important ban like you know

9383
06:00:14,478 --> 06:00:16,120
the classic if if you haven't watched

9384
06:00:16,120 --> 06:00:17,718
DOTA for a bit you're like oh Magnus now

9385
06:00:17,718 --> 06:00:19,120
there's going to be an Empower carry is

9386
06:00:19,120 --> 06:00:21,400
there anything that is a really strong

9387
06:00:21,400 --> 06:00:22,958
Empower carry that's also good against

9388
06:00:22,958 --> 06:00:24,200
Primal no it's going to be the Shadow

9389
06:00:24,200 --> 06:00:27,040
Demons right on point there um what are

9390
06:00:27,040 --> 06:00:28,958
you thinking for Spirit here are you

9391
06:00:28,958 --> 06:00:30,520
saving your Tauros hero until the very

9392
06:00:30,520 --> 06:00:32,200
end or is there something valuable you

9393
06:00:32,200 --> 06:00:34,558
could grab now against the Primal and on

9394
06:00:34,558 --> 06:00:36,360
top of that do you expect this go off

9395
06:00:36,360 --> 06:00:38,958
Lane even Quinn has played Primal as

9396
06:00:38,958 --> 06:00:41,360
well um I would probably think they want

9397
06:00:41,360 --> 06:00:42,520
to wait just because there is that

9398
06:00:42,520 --> 06:00:44,760
potential of the flex I think when you

9399
06:00:44,760 --> 06:00:45,958
play with Magnus you actually don't need

9400
06:00:45,958 --> 06:00:47,280
to think FL down power too much for

9401
06:00:47,280 --> 06:00:48,760
example if you play some PA with Magnus

9402
06:00:48,760 --> 06:00:50,000
usually you actually still buy a battle

9403
06:00:50,000 --> 06:00:52,680
Fury just because dota's there's just a

9404
06:00:52,680 --> 06:00:53,798
lot of camps you don't want to make one

9405
06:00:53,798 --> 06:00:55,360
of your other cores run to another core

9406
06:00:55,360 --> 06:00:57,400
in order just to empower you I think

9407
06:00:57,400 --> 06:00:58,878
right now they should think that they've

9408
06:00:58,878 --> 06:01:00,240
given the Primal Beast right now they

9409
06:01:00,240 --> 06:01:01,600
need something that does enough damage

9410
06:01:01,600 --> 06:01:04,200
to kill I think probably do you know if

9411
06:01:04,200 --> 06:01:06,680
a was banned last game or is it just

9412
06:01:06,680 --> 06:01:07,920
I I think that's sort of rare for this

9413
06:01:07,920 --> 06:01:09,040
tournament honestly I think it was

9414
06:01:09,040 --> 06:01:10,798
picked and Bann pretty much first phase

9415
06:01:10,798 --> 06:01:12,080
in like most of the other games I've

9416
06:01:12,080 --> 06:01:13,478
seen I think they could look at

9417
06:01:13,478 --> 06:01:15,360
something a you see Phoenix is already

9418
06:01:15,360 --> 06:01:17,680
out and um the shallow Demon's out so I

9419
06:01:17,680 --> 06:01:18,798
think they want to make sure that they

9420
06:01:18,798 --> 06:01:21,280
get a support who can deal with this

9421
06:01:21,280 --> 06:01:24,760
Primal a looks pretty interesting like

9422
06:01:24,760 --> 06:01:27,920
um but it's also need a good partner on

9423
06:01:27,920 --> 06:01:29,638
Lane because it's not the strongest

9424
06:01:29,638 --> 06:01:32,440
laner I guess on uh easy Lane but moska

9425
06:01:32,440 --> 06:01:34,798
plays it very very good like on next

9426
06:01:34,798 --> 06:01:38,440
level Gladiators turn to enchantress

9427
06:01:38,440 --> 06:01:40,360
that's a five that is strong in Lane

9428
06:01:40,360 --> 06:01:43,520
I've heard um we going to do a cringey

9429
06:01:43,520 --> 06:01:45,638
me they're going to cringe the mid this

9430
06:01:45,638 --> 06:01:47,600
one with enchantress for sure this is

9431
06:01:47,600 --> 06:01:50,000
one of Mosa's like signature Heroes he's

9432
06:01:50,000 --> 06:01:51,558
really good at this and I think when you

9433
06:01:51,558 --> 06:01:54,400
do play a hero like Magnus who will take

9434
06:01:54,400 --> 06:01:55,680
a little more time might be a little bit

9435
06:01:55,680 --> 06:01:58,160
slower having that early game pressure

9436
06:01:58,160 --> 06:01:59,798
can help a lot and we'll have to see

9437
06:01:59,798 --> 06:02:02,240
like I believe barl probably still can

9438
06:02:02,240 --> 06:02:03,638
play the Magnus if they want to go that

9439
06:02:03,638 --> 06:02:05,360
route but normally when you do see it on

9440
06:02:05,360 --> 06:02:07,000
Spirit you have to automatically think

9441
06:02:07,000 --> 06:02:09,718
collapse but will G also automatically

9442
06:02:09,718 --> 06:02:10,958
think collapse as well or are they going

9443
06:02:10,958 --> 06:02:12,840
to respect it and think that it could be

9444
06:02:12,840 --> 06:02:14,600
a potential midliner yeah I think

9445
06:02:14,600 --> 06:02:16,240
enchantra is also one of the supports

9446
06:02:16,240 --> 06:02:17,320
eventually you're actually the one who

9447
06:02:17,320 --> 06:02:19,760
can kill the tanky Heroes moso he pretty

9448
06:02:19,760 --> 06:02:21,478
much always plays for the hurricane Pike

9449
06:02:21,478 --> 06:02:25,000
plus um moonshard and bkb like I saw sou

9450
06:02:25,000 --> 06:02:26,160
seller he's playing for like the solar

9451
06:02:26,160 --> 06:02:28,400
CR pipe but I usually don't see go go

9452
06:02:28,400 --> 06:02:30,080
for that type of build something

9453
06:02:30,080 --> 06:02:32,840
interesting to that point is we've uh I

9454
06:02:32,840 --> 06:02:34,958
was reading over a breakdown of Team

9455
06:02:34,958 --> 06:02:37,600
Farm distribution and for team spirit I

9456
06:02:37,600 --> 06:02:39,798
think moska has a higher average gold

9457
06:02:39,798 --> 06:02:41,760
per game than mea does right so they're

9458
06:02:41,760 --> 06:02:43,360
it's clearly by design that they're

9459
06:02:43,360 --> 06:02:45,760
giving uh moska a lot of space in the

9460
06:02:45,760 --> 06:02:47,840
game as position five and obviously this

9461
06:02:47,840 --> 06:02:49,400
as you guys pointed out can turn into a

9462
06:02:49,400 --> 06:02:51,240
carry do you think there's like a

9463
06:02:51,240 --> 06:02:53,520
specific type of four that is perfect

9464
06:02:53,520 --> 06:02:56,558
for that mindset that okay if an needs

9465
06:02:56,558 --> 06:02:58,240
to take some space at some point in the

9466
06:02:58,240 --> 06:02:59,920
game and get strong this is the type of

9467
06:02:59,920 --> 06:03:01,400
four you want to pair it with or is it

9468
06:03:01,400 --> 06:03:03,160
kind of not really that relevant and

9469
06:03:03,160 --> 06:03:04,440
you're just counterpicking specific

9470
06:03:04,440 --> 06:03:07,000
Heroes rather than making it du I think

9471
06:03:07,000 --> 06:03:09,600
it's mostly mirror play style like they

9472
06:03:09,600 --> 06:03:11,680
both share the responsibilities of four

9473
06:03:11,680 --> 06:03:14,478
and five in a way so it it kind of looks

9474
06:03:14,478 --> 06:03:16,280
like we're both playing four and five

9475
06:03:16,280 --> 06:03:18,878
and even sharing Waring a lot of times

9476
06:03:18,878 --> 06:03:21,520
so I think any hero mirror when to play

9477
06:03:21,520 --> 06:03:24,200
is going to fit with troll yeah and I

9478
06:03:24,200 --> 06:03:25,600
think Mir in general he just likes to

9479
06:03:25,600 --> 06:03:27,558
play the damage that just follows up he

9480
06:03:27,558 --> 06:03:30,478
plays a lot dark Willow um he plays the

9481
06:03:30,478 --> 06:03:32,798
Phoenix as well with the grimstroke

9482
06:03:32,798 --> 06:03:34,200
skywrath these types of heroes that

9483
06:03:34,200 --> 06:03:36,200
don't Farm very fast but they go for

9484
06:03:36,200 --> 06:03:37,718
kills and of course enchantress you know

9485
06:03:37,718 --> 06:03:40,240
how fast this hero can Farm as well so

9486
06:03:40,240 --> 06:03:42,360
poto just gets more gold by nature of

9487
06:03:42,360 --> 06:03:43,840
the heroes he plays but I do like how

9488
06:03:43,840 --> 06:03:45,558
gaming gladers they're sticking to their

9489
06:03:45,558 --> 06:03:47,320
guns quite literally here with the morta

9490
06:03:47,320 --> 06:03:49,440
yet again for tofu here and I like this

9491
06:03:49,440 --> 06:03:51,240
combination a lot with the Nature's

9492
06:03:51,240 --> 06:03:53,000
profit as well you just come in you

9493
06:03:53,000 --> 06:03:54,840
sprout them you get a free Deadshot

9494
06:03:54,840 --> 06:03:56,718
Target on the Sprout and you just push

9495
06:03:56,718 --> 06:03:59,040
them back so a lot of synergy there do

9496
06:03:59,040 --> 06:04:00,718
you think there is going to be the

9497
06:04:00,718 --> 06:04:02,440
necessity for nous profit maybe even to

9498
06:04:02,440 --> 06:04:03,798
rotate like how does this Lane match up

9499
06:04:03,798 --> 06:04:05,718
go between what we're assuming is a 5%

9500
06:04:05,718 --> 06:04:06,920
position Edge playing in the safe Lane

9501
06:04:06,920 --> 06:04:09,280
versus a for mua off Lane is that is

9502
06:04:09,280 --> 06:04:10,840
that one of the matchups that mua will

9503
06:04:10,840 --> 06:04:13,080
struggle in or can she hold her own I

9504
06:04:13,080 --> 06:04:14,798
think it's a pretty St B Ling for Mora

9505
06:04:14,798 --> 06:04:16,200
it always depends a little bit for ench

9506
06:04:16,200 --> 06:04:18,040
there's a little bit element of RNG

9507
06:04:18,040 --> 06:04:19,200
sometimes you want the hard Camp to

9508
06:04:19,200 --> 06:04:20,718
spawn even if you're playing against

9509
06:04:20,718 --> 06:04:21,958
ench cuz you think you can control as

9510
06:04:21,958 --> 06:04:23,120
side but then it spawns wildkins and

9511
06:04:23,120 --> 06:04:25,558
you're like oh I guess I lost a lane but

9512
06:04:25,558 --> 06:04:27,240
I think especially with a fa void who's

9513
06:04:27,240 --> 06:04:28,958
like a more stable laner that you don't

9514
06:04:28,958 --> 06:04:30,958
harass as much you can actually use this

9515
06:04:30,958 --> 06:04:33,000
to your advantage on Morton side I think

9516
06:04:33,000 --> 06:04:34,360
most likely this is going to be ace

9517
06:04:34,360 --> 06:04:36,400
Primal if you have Primal Beast

9518
06:04:36,400 --> 06:04:38,878
together you can like um P has to be

9519
06:04:38,878 --> 06:04:39,958
really careful on the edge he can get

9520
06:04:39,958 --> 06:04:42,000
100 to zero really quickly in the

9521
06:04:42,000 --> 06:04:43,920
lane and there's the Grim stroke that

9522
06:04:43,920 --> 06:04:46,360
you are mentioning fear coming out to be

9523
06:04:46,360 --> 06:04:48,400
expected on mirror great partner for

9524
06:04:48,400 --> 06:04:50,638
magnos and overall it's pretty good hero

9525
06:04:50,638 --> 06:04:53,200
against Primal to overall void and

9526
06:04:53,200 --> 06:04:55,680
magnos is one of the best like partners

9527
06:04:55,680 --> 06:04:58,000
and this this is looking scary if it's

9528
06:04:58,000 --> 06:04:59,878
the game get delayed a bit because we

9529
06:04:59,878 --> 06:05:05,080
have insane amount of AI BB control

9530
06:05:05,840 --> 06:05:07,400
and I think if you're gaming gliders

9531
06:05:07,400 --> 06:05:08,878
here if you're fitting the bill of like

9532
06:05:08,878 --> 06:05:11,478
meeting Dao as hero the hero that kind

9533
06:05:11,478 --> 06:05:12,600
of stands out the most that they're

9534
06:05:12,600 --> 06:05:13,760
successful with this would be an

9535
06:05:13,760 --> 06:05:16,520
alchemist around this point and a lot of

9536
06:05:16,520 --> 06:05:18,040
the other Heroes he might want to go for

9537
06:05:18,040 --> 06:05:19,160
like the Razer you're not going to pick

9538
06:05:19,160 --> 06:05:22,120
that versus Faceless Void potentially if

9539
06:05:22,120 --> 06:05:24,160
they want to it could be an okay wraith

9540
06:05:24,160 --> 06:05:25,958
King game the carry it would be a bit

9541
06:05:25,958 --> 06:05:28,320
faster so I really like The Wraith King

9542
06:05:28,320 --> 06:05:29,478
actually I think it'd be really stable

9543
06:05:29,478 --> 06:05:31,080
in Lane right now I think they should

9544
06:05:31,080 --> 06:05:32,400
want something that they can leave alone

9545
06:05:32,400 --> 06:05:34,120
in the safe Lane if you have the W King

9546
06:05:34,120 --> 06:05:35,878
in the safe Lane even if your lane start

9547
06:05:35,878 --> 06:05:37,600
to go slightly bad you can just go to

9548
06:05:37,600 --> 06:05:39,080
the bat camps and this allows Fon to

9549
06:05:39,080 --> 06:05:41,240
make the plays I think right now their

9550
06:05:41,240 --> 06:05:42,798
number one priority is making sure that

9551
06:05:42,798 --> 06:05:44,360
their supports are freed up to rotate

9552
06:05:44,360 --> 06:05:46,160
onto

9553
06:05:46,160 --> 06:05:48,558
Med will this fit the bill though for

9554
06:05:48,558 --> 06:05:51,000
how Dasio has been playing in your face

9555
06:05:51,000 --> 06:05:52,600
hitting these really fast timings and

9556
06:05:52,600 --> 06:05:54,680
running at you definitely the same style

9557
06:05:54,680 --> 06:05:56,558
as like an alchemist but probably comes

9558
06:05:56,558 --> 06:05:58,200
on a little bit slower because you don't

9559
06:05:58,200 --> 06:06:00,040
get that blink as early but if he has

9560
06:06:00,040 --> 06:06:02,120
good laning stage they could do what

9561
06:06:02,120 --> 06:06:03,520
they need him to do are we getting a

9562
06:06:03,520 --> 06:06:04,878
little bit ahead of ahead of ourselves

9563
06:06:04,878 --> 06:06:06,760
here is this guarant to be Cari King

9564
06:06:06,760 --> 06:06:08,958
we've seen gaming glad off lane and they

9565
06:06:08,958 --> 06:06:10,400
could put the Primal mid I feel like the

9566
06:06:10,400 --> 06:06:12,680
flex is still there uh what would you

9567
06:06:12,680 --> 06:06:14,680
guys rather like to see if it was if you

9568
06:06:14,680 --> 06:06:15,958
were in their shoes right now do you

9569
06:06:15,958 --> 06:06:17,280
think The Wraith King one or the three

9570
06:06:17,280 --> 06:06:19,400
fits the Bild better here 10 second uh

9571
06:06:19,400 --> 06:06:20,840
I'd be really happy with the prim be on

9572
06:06:20,840 --> 06:06:21,920
three and W King on one but they

9573
06:06:21,920 --> 06:06:23,080
definitely could do it they could switch

9574
06:06:23,080 --> 06:06:25,040
it up if they even like at the end of

9575
06:06:25,040 --> 06:06:26,160
the draft they could pick another hero

9576
06:06:26,160 --> 06:06:27,760
that's flexible to our roll and just

9577
06:06:27,760 --> 06:06:29,478
keep Spirit guessing it wouldn't be a

9578
06:06:29,478 --> 06:06:31,400
bad idea I think personally though like

9579
06:06:31,400 --> 06:06:32,798
the only other her I can see sort of

9580
06:06:32,798 --> 06:06:34,200
slotting into the safe Lane would be the

9581
06:06:34,200 --> 06:06:36,400
alchemist that Fe mentioned and I'm not

9582
06:06:36,400 --> 06:06:38,080
too sure like if he does that job better

9583
06:06:38,080 --> 06:06:39,558
than King I think he's a bit more

9584
06:06:39,558 --> 06:06:41,958
susceptible pressure so they are so they

9585
06:06:41,958 --> 06:06:43,680
are thinking that it can be an offline

9586
06:06:43,680 --> 06:06:45,520
raing in mid

9587
06:06:45,520 --> 06:06:49,200
Primal yeah we can still Pi carry hero

9588
06:06:49,200 --> 06:06:51,160
too but we are not really flexing that

9589
06:06:51,160 --> 06:06:53,958
much because losp is still on Tim Spirit

9590
06:06:53,958 --> 06:06:55,240
I'm just looking at what carry heroes

9591
06:06:55,240 --> 06:06:57,600
are left that if they get banned here

9592
06:06:57,600 --> 06:06:59,638
that's going to be good vers void is rth

9593
06:06:59,638 --> 06:07:02,040
King going to be the most punishing hero

9594
06:07:02,040 --> 06:07:03,840
for a Faceless Void in the laning stage

9595
06:07:03,840 --> 06:07:05,320
as well these are all the decisions that

9596
06:07:05,320 --> 06:07:06,040
they

9597
06:07:06,040 --> 06:07:08,958
to with already greedy if it's an off

9598
06:07:08,958 --> 06:07:10,600
laner which would give you more

9599
06:07:10,600 --> 06:07:13,200
techically as carry to things but a lot

9600
06:07:13,200 --> 06:07:15,920
of the good ones that can be faster are

9601
06:07:15,920 --> 06:07:17,558
probably just going to get removed this

9602
06:07:17,558 --> 06:07:19,798
is quite a rare sight in the last phase

9603
06:07:19,798 --> 06:07:21,400
right to see a team ban one carry and

9604
06:07:21,400 --> 06:07:22,958
one off laner I think most of the time

9605
06:07:22,958 --> 06:07:24,520
you kind of commit to the one idea okay

9606
06:07:24,520 --> 06:07:26,200
this is the biggest threat is that they

9607
06:07:26,200 --> 06:07:28,280
put the heroes in this way but the way

9608
06:07:28,280 --> 06:07:29,798
Spirit seems to be approaching this is

9609
06:07:29,798 --> 06:07:31,520
these are the two specific Heroes that

9610
06:07:31,520 --> 06:07:33,240
cause the most problem for our Faceless

9611
06:07:33,240 --> 06:07:35,600
Void it seems like um do you guys think

9612
06:07:35,600 --> 06:07:36,920
this lone Droid B would have been or

9613
06:07:36,920 --> 06:07:38,160
this l Droid would have been a really

9614
06:07:38,160 --> 06:07:39,520
big problem for their safe Lane to deal

9615
06:07:39,520 --> 06:07:40,840
with I feel like that should have been a

9616
06:07:40,840 --> 06:07:42,958
spectre maybe to be honest you yeah also

9617
06:07:42,958 --> 06:07:45,040
watching a spect I thought to to point

9618
06:07:45,040 --> 06:07:47,638
it out like it uh it might give the

9619
06:07:47,638 --> 06:07:49,440
tempo what we needed because this hero

9620
06:07:49,440 --> 06:07:52,040
now like is really really aggressive and

9621
06:07:52,040 --> 06:07:54,320
it cannot add up to the F on global

9622
06:07:54,320 --> 06:07:56,400
pressure can't really get chronoed

9623
06:07:56,400 --> 06:07:58,638
either right like Magnus initiations

9624
06:07:58,638 --> 06:08:01,280
kind of get ruined by this hero it's a

9625
06:08:01,280 --> 06:08:02,240
little bit different you don't have the

9626
06:08:02,240 --> 06:08:04,360
global until you get the agms but still

9627
06:08:04,360 --> 06:08:05,840
whenever you think about playing verus a

9628
06:08:05,840 --> 06:08:07,240
face of void you want to play a hero

9629
06:08:07,240 --> 06:08:08,718
that just doesn't show up to the fights

9630
06:08:08,718 --> 06:08:11,400
with Illusions or has two lives or can

9631
06:08:11,400 --> 06:08:13,200
just have infinite jump from like

9632
06:08:13,200 --> 06:08:15,000
anywhere on the map so that could be a

9633
06:08:15,000 --> 06:08:16,638
good choice if they do want to put this

9634
06:08:16,638 --> 06:08:18,400
Primal into the mid lane these actually

9635
06:08:18,400 --> 06:08:20,280
are two pretty decent mid bands for

9636
06:08:20,280 --> 06:08:22,440
Primal as well both necr invoker I think

9637
06:08:22,440 --> 06:08:24,400
have pretty good match ups for S so I

9638
06:08:24,400 --> 06:08:25,680
think they might be looking to get a new

9639
06:08:25,680 --> 06:08:27,040
carry

9640
06:08:27,040 --> 06:08:28,600
here

9641
06:08:28,600 --> 06:08:31,280
10er B protecting against the EMP for

9642
06:08:31,280 --> 06:08:33,718
The Wraith King regardless of role team

9643
06:08:33,718 --> 06:08:37,000
I think it's it's their okay more

9644
06:08:37,000 --> 06:08:39,440
FL well this her is like pretty decent

9645
06:08:39,440 --> 06:08:41,320
in Lane versus the Magnus cuz you can

9646
06:08:41,320 --> 06:08:43,878
match his hum long his base damage

9647
06:08:43,878 --> 06:08:45,200
there's really no kill threat as well

9648
06:08:45,200 --> 06:08:47,120
with the Magnus against the morling so

9649
06:08:47,120 --> 06:08:49,080
that does help a lot and of course the

9650
06:08:49,080 --> 06:08:50,600
attribute shift will help what if you

9651
06:08:50,600 --> 06:08:53,760
get Chronos spared but this hero is slow

9652
06:08:53,760 --> 06:08:56,200
and this is not how G has been winning

9653
06:08:56,200 --> 06:08:58,320
most of their games by Dau just sitting

9654
06:08:58,320 --> 06:08:59,600
back and hitting timings they've been in

9655
06:08:59,600 --> 06:09:01,240
your face so it looks like game's

9656
06:09:01,240 --> 06:09:03,000
adapting to the series they might sort

9657
06:09:03,000 --> 06:09:04,400
of have a read cuz they have a furin

9658
06:09:04,400 --> 06:09:05,638
versus grimstroke which I think is a

9659
06:09:05,638 --> 06:09:06,920
very favorable

9660
06:09:06,920 --> 06:09:09,760
support coming Circle here um but I

9661
06:09:09,760 --> 06:09:11,680
think if morling wins his Lane then he

9662
06:09:11,680 --> 06:09:13,000
can actually be a hero that's sort of

9663
06:09:13,000 --> 06:09:14,920
impossible to kill on the map and he's

9664
06:09:14,920 --> 06:09:16,080
actually pressuring a safe Lane but you

9665
06:09:16,080 --> 06:09:17,360
have to win your lane in order for that

9666
06:09:17,360 --> 06:09:20,000
to happen uh I believe this match up the

9667
06:09:20,000 --> 06:09:21,958
morphling against Magnus was the exact

9668
06:09:21,958 --> 06:09:23,440
one that Spirit played against lgd in

9669
06:09:23,440 --> 06:09:24,798
the upper bracket is that correct I

9670
06:09:24,798 --> 06:09:26,520
think that was how they tried to solve

9671
06:09:26,520 --> 06:09:28,320
nothing to say Magnus do you think the

9672
06:09:28,320 --> 06:09:29,600
conditions here are equally good

9673
06:09:29,600 --> 06:09:30,958
obviously Spirit did come out ahead in

9674
06:09:30,958 --> 06:09:33,558
that game with yoro on the morph uh or

9675
06:09:33,558 --> 06:09:34,558
is there something to be worried about

9676
06:09:34,558 --> 06:09:36,558
for Dau

9677
06:09:36,558 --> 06:09:38,000
it's a different type of game I would

9678
06:09:38,000 --> 06:09:39,240
say because in the last game like

9679
06:09:39,240 --> 06:09:41,160
collaps was playing CK just crushing the

9680
06:09:41,160 --> 06:09:43,160
lanes which allowed joro to get the farm

9681
06:09:43,160 --> 06:09:45,080
and spirit has proven that in late game

9682
06:09:45,080 --> 06:09:46,958
they're that type of team to take

9683
06:09:46,958 --> 06:09:49,760
it all right that is uh that's going to

9684
06:09:49,760 --> 06:09:51,478
conclude the draft for us here we are

9685
06:09:51,478 --> 06:09:53,878
going to go over to a coach interview

9686
06:09:53,878 --> 06:09:56,958
with seey from gaming

9687
06:09:56,958 --> 06:09:59,360
Gladiators thank you very much yes I am

9688
06:09:59,360 --> 06:10:01,718
joined by see why of a gameing

9689
06:10:01,718 --> 06:10:05,040
Gladiators a tough game one but whenever

9690
06:10:05,040 --> 06:10:07,478
these these post game discussions happen

9691
06:10:07,478 --> 06:10:08,718
you're obviously being able to say

9692
06:10:08,718 --> 06:10:10,360
everything that we see the entire game

9693
06:10:10,360 --> 06:10:11,920
your players only have half the

9694
06:10:11,920 --> 06:10:14,000
information so whenever you're

9695
06:10:14,000 --> 06:10:15,638
debriefing do you spend much time

9696
06:10:15,638 --> 06:10:17,280
telling them this is why things went

9697
06:10:17,280 --> 06:10:18,840
wrong based off of all the information I

9698
06:10:18,840 --> 06:10:20,840
have or do you mainly focus on forget

9699
06:10:20,840 --> 06:10:22,000
about it here's what we're going to do

9700
06:10:22,000 --> 06:10:24,400
for game two uh it depends a bit

9701
06:10:24,400 --> 06:10:26,520
sometimes you need to readjust like um

9702
06:10:26,520 --> 06:10:28,440
how you value certain Heroes for example

9703
06:10:28,440 --> 06:10:30,280
in the draft but it also depends a bit

9704
06:10:30,280 --> 06:10:32,120
on Lanes let's say the lanes go bad okay

9705
06:10:32,120 --> 06:10:33,958
it's reset go next game right you don't

9706
06:10:33,958 --> 06:10:35,478
want to be too affected about it also

9707
06:10:35,478 --> 06:10:36,798
depends like this tournament I can hear

9708
06:10:36,798 --> 06:10:38,558
the communication so I can hear it's

9709
06:10:38,558 --> 06:10:40,360
like chill still like we're like not

9710
06:10:40,360 --> 06:10:42,000
stressed or anything like that so I

9711
06:10:42,000 --> 06:10:43,520
don't really need to do any work in that

9712
06:10:43,520 --> 06:10:45,798
regard so I kind of consider what I have

9713
06:10:45,798 --> 06:10:47,638
to say and what I don't have to say and

9714
06:10:47,638 --> 06:10:49,400
then take it from there how about the

9715
06:10:49,400 --> 06:10:51,160
lanes for this game we got good

9716
06:10:51,160 --> 06:10:52,558
expectations on how the first seven

9717
06:10:52,558 --> 06:10:54,400
minutes are going to go for you I have

9718
06:10:54,400 --> 06:10:56,400
good expectations so uh I hope my boys

9719
06:10:56,400 --> 06:10:59,160
can live up to it I hope you guys are up

9720
06:10:59,160 --> 06:11:01,440
for it also cuz we're getting ready for

9721
06:11:01,440 --> 06:11:03,160
game number

9722
06:11:03,160 --> 06:11:06,400
two this game needs to start off very

9723
06:11:06,400 --> 06:11:08,400
well for gaming Gladiators because while

9724
06:11:08,400 --> 06:11:10,840
this may be a best of five this game too

9725
06:11:10,840 --> 06:11:13,200
feels particularly important Avery I

9726
06:11:13,200 --> 06:11:15,680
mean last game Spirit they took your

9727
06:11:15,680 --> 06:11:17,718
best trait your speed took it away from

9728
06:11:17,718 --> 06:11:19,080
you and turned it right back around they

9729
06:11:19,080 --> 06:11:21,360
ended that game so fast and this time

9730
06:11:21,360 --> 06:11:22,520
they're going to take the late game and

9731
06:11:22,520 --> 06:11:25,200
the scale right void Magnus this is a

9732
06:11:25,200 --> 06:11:27,200
lineup that is very happy to go into

9733
06:11:27,200 --> 06:11:29,040
that late game and particularly when you

9734
06:11:29,040 --> 06:11:30,320
have your Toro in the range of this face

9735
06:11:30,320 --> 06:11:32,798
is voided is a fearsome Beast this is a

9736
06:11:32,798 --> 06:11:34,360
strat that goes all the way back to I

9737
06:11:34,360 --> 06:11:36,840
remember TI 6 ti5 era where people are

9738
06:11:36,840 --> 06:11:39,080
developing the Magnus Wings gaming were

9739
06:11:39,080 --> 06:11:40,840
a team that took this Strat all the way

9740
06:11:40,840 --> 06:11:42,558
to the Grand finals we're happy to play

9741
06:11:42,558 --> 06:11:44,080
this Magnus with the void particularly

9742
06:11:44,080 --> 06:11:46,080
on Shadow so this is a throwback for me

9743
06:11:46,080 --> 06:11:47,680
being back in Seattle seeing this once

9744
06:11:47,680 --> 06:11:50,040
more on the main stage here we're going

9745
06:11:50,040 --> 06:11:51,558
to see what team spirit can do to get to

9746
06:11:51,558 --> 06:11:53,958
that late game once again against gaming

9747
06:11:53,958 --> 06:11:56,320
who have continually punish teams for

9748
06:11:56,320 --> 06:11:58,478
the Greed for the slowness for the uh

9749
06:11:58,478 --> 06:12:00,240
willingness to go to 60 to 70 minutes

9750
06:12:00,240 --> 06:12:01,440
they just don't let want to let you get

9751
06:12:01,440 --> 06:12:03,240
there but here they've gone for kind of

9752
06:12:03,240 --> 06:12:05,400
a hybrid draft right going for more in

9753
06:12:05,400 --> 06:12:08,798
their own hands on Daio a hero he is

9754
06:12:08,798 --> 06:12:11,680
perhaps more Infamous more than Infamous

9755
06:12:11,680 --> 06:12:14,240
more than for than famous for yeah in

9756
06:12:14,240 --> 06:12:16,638
some sense well I mean a uh the right

9757
06:12:16,638 --> 06:12:19,280
kind of performance on a TI final that

9758
06:12:19,280 --> 06:12:21,320
could change the entire narrative about

9759
06:12:21,320 --> 06:12:23,600
his morphling he's going to try and do

9760
06:12:23,600 --> 06:12:26,878
just that by taking away and taking down

9761
06:12:26,878 --> 06:12:29,798
y Toro's Faceless Void but there's also

9762
06:12:29,798 --> 06:12:31,478
some other notable Heroes I feel like we

9763
06:12:31,478 --> 06:12:33,600
focused a lot on Yuro in that last game

9764
06:12:33,600 --> 06:12:34,798
for a good reason he had a monster

9765
06:12:34,798 --> 06:12:36,878
performance but there's also some other

9766
06:12:36,878 --> 06:12:38,520
big ones here for team spirit I'm

9767
06:12:38,520 --> 06:12:40,718
looking at that mosa enchantress man I

9768
06:12:40,718 --> 06:12:42,798
feel like this is enchantress and Chens

9769
06:12:42,798 --> 06:12:44,840
they are really scary in this current

9770
06:12:44,840 --> 06:12:46,600
Meta Even if we don't see them all the

9771
06:12:46,600 --> 06:12:48,360
time I mean we saw the way that Chen

9772
06:12:48,360 --> 06:12:50,200
work for G Gladiators and moska is going

9773
06:12:50,200 --> 06:12:51,638
to try and make that enchantress work

9774
06:12:51,638 --> 06:12:53,558
for the laning phase enchantress is here

9775
06:12:53,558 --> 06:12:55,558
both these teams really highly value and

9776
06:12:55,558 --> 06:12:57,160
contest her's been banned against gaming

9777
06:12:57,160 --> 06:12:59,280
a lot so they opted to take it away here

9778
06:12:59,280 --> 06:13:01,440
it's also her can deal pretty well with

9779
06:13:01,440 --> 06:13:03,040
Primal beast in those mid games with the

9780
06:13:03,040 --> 06:13:05,600
enchant ruining his charge in I don't

9781
06:13:05,600 --> 06:13:07,360
know when I saw that inch come out it

9782
06:13:07,360 --> 06:13:08,718
gave them the tempo they needed with a

9783
06:13:08,718 --> 06:13:10,280
Magnus opener to feel really good about

9784
06:13:10,280 --> 06:13:11,638
it so they just don't fall behind too

9785
06:13:11,638 --> 06:13:13,120
much on the lanes and a quick little

9786
06:13:13,120 --> 06:13:14,920
body block to push it under the tower

9787
06:13:14,920 --> 06:13:16,798
here to try and secure the equilibrium

9788
06:13:16,798 --> 06:13:19,080
very heads up play Dao Reddit got a

9789
06:13:19,080 --> 06:13:20,520
block of his own and it will end up

9790
06:13:20,520 --> 06:13:22,840
outside the tower so nice headit up play

9791
06:13:22,840 --> 06:13:25,000
by Dau to counteract that as they're

9792
06:13:25,000 --> 06:13:27,160
going to start three top maybe looking

9793
06:13:27,160 --> 06:13:29,080
for a cheeky kill on the furion who's TP

9794
06:13:29,080 --> 06:13:30,040
up

9795
06:13:30,040 --> 06:13:33,360
here yeah that would actually be uh an

9796
06:13:33,360 --> 06:13:35,440
interesting idea but they quickly

9797
06:13:35,440 --> 06:13:38,958
abandoned that celery waves goodbye to

9798
06:13:38,958 --> 06:13:41,680
the enchantress as moska heads back down

9799
06:13:41,680 --> 06:13:43,080
to that bottom Lane which is going to be

9800
06:13:43,080 --> 06:13:46,360
ace and tofu in the muera plus wraith

9801
06:13:46,360 --> 06:13:49,360
King the double Undead hero Against The

9802
06:13:49,360 --> 06:13:52,760
Faceless Void of yoro and a very deadly

9803
06:13:52,760 --> 06:13:54,160
Lane as well we've seen a lot of like

9804
06:13:54,160 --> 06:13:55,878
the waith king Dark Willow come back

9805
06:13:55,878 --> 06:13:58,000
that was a classic a couple TI ago

9806
06:13:58,000 --> 06:14:00,638
wraith King Mor equally as strong you

9807
06:14:00,638 --> 06:14:02,558
get the insta stun into silence into

9808
06:14:02,558 --> 06:14:04,120
Deadshot pushes you back in your attack

9809
06:14:04,120 --> 06:14:05,878
speed so you can't fight skeletons are

9810
06:14:05,878 --> 06:14:08,240
hitting you very high kill threat on

9811
06:14:08,240 --> 06:14:09,520
this Lane and a lot of pushing power if

9812
06:14:09,520 --> 06:14:10,840
you start to run away with it so this is

9813
06:14:10,840 --> 06:14:12,920
an off Lan for G they want to go very

9814
06:14:12,920 --> 06:14:14,440
well they want Ace to drive the tempo

9815
06:14:14,440 --> 06:14:15,878
and the objective control of the game

9816
06:14:15,878 --> 06:14:17,280
which is something he didn't get to do

9817
06:14:17,280 --> 06:14:19,320
last time because team spe brought the

9818
06:14:19,320 --> 06:14:21,638
gank parade to him right so that's a big

9819
06:14:21,638 --> 06:14:23,240
question as well do Spirit decide to

9820
06:14:23,240 --> 06:14:24,638
commit the same resources into shutting

9821
06:14:24,638 --> 06:14:26,840
Ace down this time around and does that

9822
06:14:26,840 --> 06:14:28,760
just inadvertently free up more room for

9823
06:14:28,760 --> 06:14:31,280
Daio on a hero that I feel like has a

9824
06:14:31,280 --> 06:14:33,120
better time this game than the gyro did

9825
06:14:33,120 --> 06:14:35,080
in that last one it's a stronger hero

9826
06:14:35,080 --> 06:14:37,920
The Meta and decent matchups and yep

9827
06:14:37,920 --> 06:14:39,600
already on the board yeah you said this

9828
06:14:39,600 --> 06:14:41,718
combo is deadly any sort of four

9829
06:14:41,718 --> 06:14:43,280
position that can output some good

9830
06:14:43,280 --> 06:14:45,680
damage off that R fire blast you got to

9831
06:14:45,680 --> 06:14:47,400
be careful if you're a support in Lane

9832
06:14:47,400 --> 06:14:49,478
gaming Gladiators will find the opening

9833
06:14:49,478 --> 06:14:51,718
kill and this early game is going to be

9834
06:14:51,718 --> 06:14:53,680
a question for gaming in terms of how

9835
06:14:53,680 --> 06:14:54,760
much they get out of it because they

9836
06:14:54,760 --> 06:14:56,680
have the fury on the can TP accelerate

9837
06:14:56,680 --> 06:14:58,120
the lane ganks they have a primal Beast

9838
06:14:58,120 --> 06:14:59,920
who can just gobble up runes gang s side

9839
06:14:59,920 --> 06:15:02,520
Lanes very early he is the king of it

9840
06:15:02,520 --> 06:15:04,040
maybe not a hero we've seen Quinn play a

9841
06:15:04,040 --> 06:15:06,798
lot but one he is practiced very well in

9842
06:15:06,798 --> 06:15:08,840
pubs recently and is very comfortable on

9843
06:15:08,840 --> 06:15:10,040
so this could be an incredibly fast

9844
06:15:10,040 --> 06:15:11,360
early game just in terms of the gank

9845
06:15:11,360 --> 06:15:12,520
potential not necessarily just taking

9846
06:15:12,520 --> 06:15:14,440
your Towers which is also a reason if

9847
06:15:14,440 --> 06:15:16,280
that r King Lane goes really well for

9848
06:15:16,280 --> 06:15:17,680
gaming it's a lane they can easily

9849
06:15:17,680 --> 06:15:19,760
rotate to cuz again the kill thrat is so

9850
06:15:19,760 --> 06:15:22,160
damn High the heal too much and now

9851
06:15:22,160 --> 06:15:23,478
they're going to turn back around with

9852
06:15:23,478 --> 06:15:26,160
the Nature's attendance leveled

9853
06:15:26,160 --> 06:15:28,760
up and Ace will take a bit of damage as

9854
06:15:28,760 --> 06:15:30,478
he heads back in but yoro doesn't want

9855
06:15:30,478 --> 06:15:32,958
to miss his CS right now lanes are going

9856
06:15:32,958 --> 06:15:35,080
pretty well for uh despite that early

9857
06:15:35,080 --> 06:15:38,160
First Blood we got the Pango taking the

9858
06:15:38,160 --> 06:15:41,638
top spot on the Cs chart nice

9859
06:15:41,638 --> 06:15:43,760
Deadshot see how much Laurel can do with

9860
06:15:43,760 --> 06:15:45,440
this it was kind of a quiet Pango game

9861
06:15:45,440 --> 06:15:47,200
last time around right I I think Quinn

9862
06:15:47,200 --> 06:15:49,160
was struggling to to find his openings

9863
06:15:49,160 --> 06:15:51,280
and if this is a hero you can get to

9864
06:15:51,280 --> 06:15:52,558
play your Tempo game to control the

9865
06:15:52,558 --> 06:15:53,878
runes combat where Quinn wants to go

9866
06:15:53,878 --> 06:15:54,920
with the final Beast you can definitely

9867
06:15:54,920 --> 06:15:56,320
turn some of those ganks around I think

9868
06:15:56,320 --> 06:15:59,000
that's what L's looking more more than

9869
06:15:59,000 --> 06:16:00,878
being the aggressive right I think him

9870
06:16:00,878 --> 06:16:02,240
just going in these Lanes is going to be

9871
06:16:02,240 --> 06:16:03,000
difficult cuz you don't have a lot of

9872
06:16:03,000 --> 06:16:05,680
damage W but if gam over extend dive you

9873
06:16:05,680 --> 06:16:07,240
under one of these s side L tier ones

9874
06:16:07,240 --> 06:16:08,400
then suddenly the Pango can come in with

9875
06:16:08,400 --> 06:16:09,920
a counter gank and the ring Thunder and

9876
06:16:09,920 --> 06:16:11,440
turn things around you're really happy

9877
06:16:11,440 --> 06:16:12,878
with that type of gameplay here cuz

9878
06:16:12,878 --> 06:16:14,320
again you're farming it up you got

9879
06:16:14,320 --> 06:16:16,240
Magnus Faceless Void you know gaming are

9880
06:16:16,240 --> 06:16:18,360
going to go into you this is a hard Duo

9881
06:16:18,360 --> 06:16:21,000
to match up against you throw that

9882
06:16:21,000 --> 06:16:23,958
Inkwell on the Magnus he pulls you

9883
06:16:23,958 --> 06:16:25,878
closer with the shock wave you get hit

9884
06:16:25,878 --> 06:16:28,360
by the stun and then that stun leads

9885
06:16:28,360 --> 06:16:30,240
into a free skewer back so even

9886
06:16:30,240 --> 06:16:33,400
underneath your Tower you are not safe

9887
06:16:33,400 --> 06:16:34,680
and the Grim Shard could be really nice

9888
06:16:34,680 --> 06:16:36,120
as game as well just throwing it on

9889
06:16:36,120 --> 06:16:37,958
these cores that want to jump in get the

9890
06:16:37,958 --> 06:16:40,600
extra you know debuff them out reset the

9891
06:16:40,600 --> 06:16:42,600
the fight or the Primal these types of

9892
06:16:42,600 --> 06:16:44,000
interactions could help them take the

9893
06:16:44,000 --> 06:16:46,080
team fights in the mid game when they're

9894
06:16:46,080 --> 06:16:47,520
likely going to be behind a little bit

9895
06:16:47,520 --> 06:16:49,558
in terms of the speed right cuz gaming

9896
06:16:49,558 --> 06:16:51,240
are pulling a decent position out in

9897
06:16:51,240 --> 06:16:53,240
terms of the lane phase here doing

9898
06:16:53,240 --> 06:16:54,558
pretty well on their cores in terms of

9899
06:16:54,558 --> 06:16:57,360
Cs they gave him the harpy that's going

9900
06:16:57,360 --> 06:16:58,718
to make a big difference in this bottom

9901
06:16:58,718 --> 06:17:00,798
Lane going to die now but does some

9902
06:17:00,798 --> 06:17:03,718
decent economic damage and he's got a

9903
06:17:03,718 --> 06:17:05,478
small little hell bear to work too I

9904
06:17:05,478 --> 06:17:07,120
mean it's also just time time yor gets

9905
06:17:07,120 --> 06:17:09,400
to sit down here vers that eventually

9906
06:17:09,400 --> 06:17:11,840
will kick him out qu amping up the

9907
06:17:11,840 --> 06:17:13,920
pressure here has a little bit of an XP

9908
06:17:13,920 --> 06:17:15,878
Advantage pushing this triple ranged

9909
06:17:15,878 --> 06:17:18,240
wave I mean this is it's pretty rare you

9910
06:17:18,240 --> 06:17:20,760
get three range creeps being pushed into

9911
06:17:20,760 --> 06:17:23,200
the tower L will clean it all up no Rome

9912
06:17:23,200 --> 06:17:25,680
coming in early here just way too high

9913
06:17:25,680 --> 06:17:28,440
on the the HP to make it look enticing

9914
06:17:28,440 --> 06:17:30,320
and of course these Sid Lanes vital to

9915
06:17:30,320 --> 06:17:31,958
your game plan still he's just going to

9916
06:17:31,958 --> 06:17:33,520
go for it here comes the rotation though

9917
06:17:33,520 --> 06:17:35,040
miror gives him the in swell under under

9918
06:17:35,040 --> 06:17:36,520
the tower but he stops him Midway

9919
06:17:36,520 --> 06:17:38,478
through the charge and Quinn caught

9920
06:17:38,478 --> 06:17:40,680
underneath the tower will

9921
06:17:40,680 --> 06:17:42,878
die sometimes greed is good and

9922
06:17:42,878 --> 06:17:44,840
sometimes you get punished for it mea

9923
06:17:44,840 --> 06:17:47,120
happy to counter that push Laurel ahead

9924
06:17:47,120 --> 06:17:48,320
in the XP now you're going to have a

9925
06:17:48,320 --> 06:17:50,798
rolling thunder what a sprout collapse

9926
06:17:50,798 --> 06:17:52,478
cut down a tree but he was still stuck

9927
06:17:52,478 --> 06:17:54,400
on the corner there did have some stick

9928
06:17:54,400 --> 06:17:56,600
charges to work with though and so he

9929
06:17:56,600 --> 06:17:58,920
will survive for now they wanted to be

9930
06:17:58,920 --> 06:18:00,440
able to punish the fact that mea had to

9931
06:18:00,440 --> 06:18:02,600
TP into that mid lane but couldn't quite

9932
06:18:02,600 --> 06:18:04,520
finish the job it's a game about

9933
06:18:04,520 --> 06:18:05,680
pressure every time one of these

9934
06:18:05,680 --> 06:18:07,080
supports makes a move you need to create

9935
06:18:07,080 --> 06:18:09,440
the pressure somewhere else so the enemy

9936
06:18:09,440 --> 06:18:10,718
just can't Clump on you get the numbers

9937
06:18:10,718 --> 06:18:12,160
you too gets pushed back into the

9938
06:18:12,160 --> 06:18:14,600
silence oh he time walks up now he's

9939
06:18:14,600 --> 06:18:16,200
still kind of in a sticky spot here

9940
06:18:16,200 --> 06:18:17,400
gaming Gladiators are going to try and

9941
06:18:17,400 --> 06:18:18,558
run him down look at him throw the blood

9942
06:18:18,558 --> 06:18:20,878
grenade but he'll make the difference

9943
06:18:20,878 --> 06:18:22,240
he's going to show up with that Rolling

9944
06:18:22,240 --> 06:18:23,638
Thunder do manage to finish him up with

9945
06:18:23,638 --> 06:18:26,080
the two supports but laurl he'll be

9946
06:18:26,080 --> 06:18:29,120
collecting some heads here even the wolf

9947
06:18:29,120 --> 06:18:30,680
gets a couple hits in stuck there on the

9948
06:18:30,680 --> 06:18:32,280
corner but that's okay the swash Buckle

9949
06:18:32,280 --> 06:18:34,040
will finish the job a lot of XP going

9950
06:18:34,040 --> 06:18:36,680
into the Pango on the down here yoro

9951
06:18:36,680 --> 06:18:38,080
little sad he died there and doesn't get

9952
06:18:38,080 --> 06:18:39,320
it for himself but I mean that's

9953
06:18:39,320 --> 06:18:40,520
sometimes the life of a Faceless Void

9954
06:18:40,520 --> 06:18:41,718
versus a lineup that is going to

9955
06:18:41,718 --> 06:18:43,000
pressure you is going to go for that

9956
06:18:43,000 --> 06:18:45,000
kill and if it was a lot cleaner maybe

9957
06:18:45,000 --> 06:18:47,000
gaming can just walk that off but team

9958
06:18:47,000 --> 06:18:49,000
spirit they get the rotation in suddenly

9959
06:18:49,000 --> 06:18:50,878
these Pango having a terrific game off

9960
06:18:50,878 --> 06:18:52,718
of that in the turn around mid and those

9961
06:18:52,718 --> 06:18:54,240
are those counter turns that lel's

9962
06:18:54,240 --> 06:18:56,200
looking for right yeah Force the ra King

9963
06:18:56,200 --> 06:18:57,840
in force this moring into an aggressive

9964
06:18:57,840 --> 06:19:00,160
situation maybe Quinn Dives you and

9965
06:19:00,160 --> 06:19:01,440
that's when you get the strike here

9966
06:19:01,440 --> 06:19:02,840
Arcane Rune picked up for Quinn this is

9967
06:19:02,840 --> 06:19:06,120
a really nice Rune on the hero see IFC

9968
06:19:06,120 --> 06:19:07,638
pops it here to try and deal with mea

9969
06:19:07,638 --> 06:19:09,200
the silence is going to last a while can

9970
06:19:09,200 --> 06:19:12,080
he get it yes Quinn very fast with the

9971
06:19:12,080 --> 06:19:13,200
trigger there does manage to get him

9972
06:19:13,200 --> 06:19:15,320
collapse going to try and dissuade Quinn

9973
06:19:15,320 --> 06:19:17,400
of that notion and he does manage to do

9974
06:19:17,400 --> 06:19:19,200
so successfully keeping him off his

9975
06:19:19,200 --> 06:19:21,478
support and the quelling saving me at

9976
06:19:21,478 --> 06:19:23,478
the end from the Sprout so value pick up

9977
06:19:23,478 --> 06:19:25,760
already for him Tower Arcane run still

9978
06:19:25,760 --> 06:19:27,200
in the bottle so Quin can still look for

9979
06:19:27,200 --> 06:19:29,000
a rotation off this and he probably

9980
06:19:29,000 --> 06:19:30,240
wants to I mean his early game is

9981
06:19:30,240 --> 06:19:31,920
getting a little slow here and you have

9982
06:19:31,920 --> 06:19:33,680
threat on the sidelines right this is

9983
06:19:33,680 --> 06:19:35,240
where the prime will be break really

9984
06:19:35,240 --> 06:19:36,840
hard really fast gets momentum going for

9985
06:19:36,840 --> 06:19:39,638
the team that's your theoretical ideal

9986
06:19:39,638 --> 06:19:42,840
you just shove in mid make the move wisd

9987
06:19:42,840 --> 06:19:44,840
run there is a

9988
06:19:44,840 --> 06:19:46,840
furrion there is there's always the

9989
06:19:46,840 --> 06:19:48,400
opportunity of the celery to try and

9990
06:19:48,400 --> 06:19:50,120
make a move but I feel like the teams

9991
06:19:50,120 --> 06:19:52,080
have been really good at protecting

9992
06:19:52,080 --> 06:19:54,040
their wisdom runes against invasions

9993
06:19:54,040 --> 06:19:57,240
particularly against the Nature's profit

9994
06:19:57,240 --> 06:19:58,558
more times than not it seems like

9995
06:19:58,558 --> 06:20:00,000
Nature's profet tries to make that kind

9996
06:20:00,000 --> 06:20:03,040
of move he just walks into a trap just a

9997
06:20:03,040 --> 06:20:04,558
hard gamble if you use your teleport for

9998
06:20:04,558 --> 06:20:06,120
that you're dead on the map for 60

9999
06:20:06,120 --> 06:20:07,600
seconds and your chances to get it

10000
06:20:07,600 --> 06:20:09,558
should be minimal in a TI Grand Final I

10001
06:20:09,558 --> 06:20:12,958
want to say yeah good deward there

10002
06:20:12,958 --> 06:20:14,360
that'll help because Quinn wants to be

10003
06:20:14,360 --> 06:20:16,120
able to make moves particularly with

10004
06:20:16,120 --> 06:20:17,320
this Arcane Rune which he's going to put

10005
06:20:17,320 --> 06:20:19,958
to use now caught a mid Shield crash so

10006
06:20:19,958 --> 06:20:21,718
that ability no longer there with the

10007
06:20:21,718 --> 06:20:24,240
two support rotations it's easy to kill

10008
06:20:24,240 --> 06:20:26,600
Laurel exactly what they're looking for

10009
06:20:26,600 --> 06:20:28,440
combine the calling Deadshot with this

10010
06:20:28,440 --> 06:20:30,600
Primal Beast anybody goes down to it at

10011
06:20:30,600 --> 06:20:31,520
this point and this is where you want to

10012
06:20:31,520 --> 06:20:33,718
ramp up the speed start getting the map

10013
06:20:33,718 --> 06:20:34,920
in a position where you can can just

10014
06:20:34,920 --> 06:20:36,440
guarantee the power runes for Quinn and

10015
06:20:36,440 --> 06:20:38,160
get the connections going and hopefully

10016
06:20:38,160 --> 06:20:39,680
lead to like jungle Invasion right

10017
06:20:39,680 --> 06:20:40,520
because the one thing you have to think

10018
06:20:40,520 --> 06:20:42,478
about with the Magnus is the stacks and

10019
06:20:42,478 --> 06:20:43,638
if their carry just gets to sit in

10020
06:20:43,638 --> 06:20:45,080
Triangle on double ancients and clear

10021
06:20:45,080 --> 06:20:46,400
through them at that point in time the

10022
06:20:46,400 --> 06:20:47,920
earlier you take down these tier ones

10023
06:20:47,920 --> 06:20:49,400
the earlier you get aggressive OBS out

10024
06:20:49,400 --> 06:20:50,478
the happier you're going to be when that

10025
06:20:50,478 --> 06:20:52,360
period comes another Power Rune should

10026
06:20:52,360 --> 06:20:54,320
be secure from Quinn here oh these runes

10027
06:20:54,320 --> 06:20:55,840
are getting a little crazy no that

10028
06:20:55,840 --> 06:20:59,040
skewer plays against collapse as he does

10029
06:20:59,040 --> 06:21:00,718
a ton of damage onto himself thanks to

10030
06:21:00,718 --> 06:21:02,400
the trample from Quin blocked out by his

10031
06:21:02,400 --> 06:21:03,558
own Sprout though he's going to try and

10032
06:21:03,558 --> 06:21:05,360
get to the other side of this Cliff LL

10033
06:21:05,360 --> 06:21:07,360
does hop down to chase after him though

10034
06:21:07,360 --> 06:21:10,440
LL showing the power of a non-real hero

10035
06:21:10,440 --> 06:21:12,120
in his hands as he will take that Rune

10036
06:21:12,120 --> 06:21:14,520
away from Quinn no haste I mean that

10037
06:21:14,520 --> 06:21:15,558
that's what of those situations you

10038
06:21:15,558 --> 06:21:17,160
almost rather take the haste R it's so

10039
06:21:17,160 --> 06:21:19,520
damn good on your hero collapse will

10040
06:21:19,520 --> 06:21:22,520
suicide himself to take Quinn out in the

10041
06:21:22,520 --> 06:21:24,920
process yeah got to have to be careful

10042
06:21:24,920 --> 06:21:26,718
with those skewers against the Primal

10043
06:21:26,718 --> 06:21:29,718
Beast that kind of movement could be

10044
06:21:29,718 --> 06:21:31,080
deadly look at this just a quick

10045
06:21:31,080 --> 06:21:32,440
rotation from the supports power of

10046
06:21:32,440 --> 06:21:34,638
enchantress early creep takes down 2/3

10047
06:21:34,638 --> 06:21:36,638
this tier one mid yeah didn't even feel

10048
06:21:36,638 --> 06:21:38,040
like that was a real move but they still

10049
06:21:38,040 --> 06:21:39,478
got a lot of this tier one Tower damage

10050
06:21:39,478 --> 06:21:41,798
out from it once again it's G responding

10051
06:21:41,798 --> 06:21:43,798
to some early objective pressure the

10052
06:21:43,798 --> 06:21:45,760
whole time this is happening it's also

10053
06:21:45,760 --> 06:21:47,200
space on the sidelanes which means the

10054
06:21:47,200 --> 06:21:48,840
atoro got the catch up a bit he's not

10055
06:21:48,840 --> 06:21:50,200
the one getting ganked or killed by the

10056
06:21:50,200 --> 06:21:52,600
calling here very happy with that Ace

10057
06:21:52,600 --> 06:21:54,520
not able to force him off Lane yet

10058
06:21:54,520 --> 06:21:55,718
however gaming doing a bit of stacking

10059
06:21:55,718 --> 06:21:57,840
of their own and maybe that selling they

10060
06:21:57,840 --> 06:21:59,200
took out of that game one right like you

10061
06:21:59,200 --> 06:22:00,760
go in game one you try and run Spirit

10062
06:22:00,760 --> 06:22:03,558
over instead they run you over okay this

10063
06:22:03,558 --> 06:22:04,920
is not a team we're going to be in 20

10064
06:22:04,920 --> 06:22:05,958
minutes not a team we're going to beat

10065
06:22:05,958 --> 06:22:08,000
in 25 maybe we go back to some of other

10066
06:22:08,000 --> 06:22:09,760
tricks other things up Our Sleeve like

10067
06:22:09,760 --> 06:22:11,920
the efficiency on the map this is a team

10068
06:22:11,920 --> 06:22:13,760
that is stacked their whole way through

10069
06:22:13,760 --> 06:22:16,040
the season going back to it now when it

10070
06:22:16,040 --> 06:22:18,360
matters and particular particular

10071
06:22:18,360 --> 06:22:21,000
strength of Western Europe in general so

10072
06:22:21,000 --> 06:22:23,160
I love those DPC matches throughout the

10073
06:22:23,160 --> 06:22:26,440
year stacking was a big factor for all

10074
06:22:26,440 --> 06:22:28,600
of those teams Ace he does have The

10075
06:22:28,600 --> 06:22:29,840
Reincarnation here but it looks like

10076
06:22:29,840 --> 06:22:31,320
team spirit want to try and burn it away

10077
06:22:31,320 --> 06:22:34,280
from him the skeletons will push back

10078
06:22:34,280 --> 06:22:35,478
though

10079
06:22:35,478 --> 06:22:37,320
is chased away brother against brother

10080
06:22:37,320 --> 06:22:40,320
here who skeletons are better well right

10081
06:22:40,320 --> 06:22:42,000
now it's going to be Quinn trying to

10082
06:22:42,000 --> 06:22:43,520
jump in but immediately stopped by

10083
06:22:43,520 --> 06:22:45,360
Laurel once again with the counter

10084
06:22:45,360 --> 06:22:46,760
initiation Quinn's trying to get out of

10085
06:22:46,760 --> 06:22:48,080
here but he's going to be cough inks

10086
06:22:48,080 --> 06:22:49,320
well plus the sil is going to try and

10087
06:22:49,320 --> 06:22:50,958
trample his way over the left hand side

10088
06:22:50,958 --> 06:22:52,760
and he is slowed down pull back in by

10089
06:22:52,760 --> 06:22:55,200
collapse though oh and a chronosphere

10090
06:22:55,200 --> 06:22:56,520
actually locking away these two other

10091
06:22:56,520 --> 06:22:58,600
cores right in Fr this Tower celer he's

10092
06:22:58,600 --> 06:23:00,160
trying to stop him now as they turn back

10093
06:23:00,160 --> 06:23:01,638
around on Ace trying to finish him up

10094
06:23:01,638 --> 06:23:03,878
there goes that reincarnation Daio

10095
06:23:03,878 --> 06:23:05,240
doesn't have much man to work with and

10096
06:23:05,240 --> 06:23:07,200
on the Fresh Life a going to be pulled

10097
06:23:07,200 --> 06:23:09,240
back underneath that Tower again just

10098
06:23:09,240 --> 06:23:11,600
like Quinn they are in trouble now Dao's

10099
06:23:11,600 --> 06:23:13,080
under this one as well surrounded by

10100
06:23:13,080 --> 06:23:14,240
five Heroes he's going to start

10101
06:23:14,240 --> 06:23:15,360
desperately morphing in his strength and

10102
06:23:15,360 --> 06:23:16,718
try and wait for him over the left hand

10103
06:23:16,718 --> 06:23:19,360
side but with all of this damage he just

10104
06:23:19,360 --> 06:23:22,080
cannot get far enough away gaming

10105
06:23:22,080 --> 06:23:24,760
Gladiators will lose all three of their

10106
06:23:24,760 --> 06:23:27,320
cores and that attempt at a fight at

10107
06:23:27,320 --> 06:23:29,360
bottom Lane that is the danger of making

10108
06:23:29,360 --> 06:23:30,718
an aggressive move into this pangle

10109
06:23:30,718 --> 06:23:32,240
grimstroke the turn around potential is

10110
06:23:32,240 --> 06:23:34,920
just so damn high and time dilate

10111
06:23:34,920 --> 06:23:37,320
absolutely ruined Daio as he goes in

10112
06:23:37,320 --> 06:23:39,520
that engagement gets time dilated can't

10113
06:23:39,520 --> 06:23:41,360
do anything for the rest of the fight

10114
06:23:41,360 --> 06:23:43,558
and of course Quinn he ate the big ult

10115
06:23:43,558 --> 06:23:45,040
still trying to make something happen in

10116
06:23:45,040 --> 06:23:46,878
this early game with a very aggressive

10117
06:23:46,878 --> 06:23:48,400
mid that can do it but he's just

10118
06:23:48,400 --> 06:23:50,400
struggling her's a bit too tanky for him

10119
06:23:50,400 --> 06:23:52,878
to bring down alone and the combinations

10120
06:23:52,878 --> 06:23:54,680
they haven't been exactly on point for

10121
06:23:54,680 --> 06:23:56,200
gaming this will give a really nice bump

10122
06:23:56,200 --> 06:23:58,440
to Laurel who is just beasting on these

10123
06:23:58,440 --> 06:24:00,000
early game fights it's going to be a

10124
06:24:00,000 --> 06:24:02,360
very fast pangle diffusal in this game

10125
06:24:02,360 --> 06:24:03,400
and these are some Heroes that are

10126
06:24:03,400 --> 06:24:05,160
susceptible to Mana right you're looking

10127
06:24:05,160 --> 06:24:07,718
at two strengthes and a morphing that

10128
06:24:07,718 --> 06:24:08,760
also doesn't like his Mana getting

10129
06:24:08,760 --> 06:24:10,638
burned with an early diffusal back to

10130
06:24:10,638 --> 06:24:12,120
clearing some Stacks the net worth still

10131
06:24:12,120 --> 06:24:13,520
looking pretty good for ging but the

10132
06:24:13,520 --> 06:24:15,520
fights fights are just not going their

10133
06:24:15,520 --> 06:24:17,240
way particularly when you know The

10134
06:24:17,240 --> 06:24:19,040
Wraith King wants to rush this Radiance

10135
06:24:19,040 --> 06:24:21,558
as quick as possible we which means an A

10136
06:24:21,558 --> 06:24:23,718
Shard he really doesn't want to have to

10137
06:24:23,718 --> 06:24:25,320
buy that until at least after the

10138
06:24:25,320 --> 06:24:26,798
radiance there's definitely in timing

10139
06:24:26,798 --> 06:24:30,520
here where this Pango could punish Ace

10140
06:24:30,520 --> 06:24:33,280
heavily especially since it's just done

10141
06:24:33,280 --> 06:24:36,520
is 1130 Arcane Boo diffusal this is

10142
06:24:36,520 --> 06:24:38,958
crazy fast in a game where they maybe

10143
06:24:38,958 --> 06:24:41,000
expected Laurel to not have the freest

10144
06:24:41,000 --> 06:24:43,040
time right up against the Primal Beast

10145
06:24:43,040 --> 06:24:45,760
with a furion who can

10146
06:24:45,760 --> 06:24:48,000
rotate they're supposed to shut him out

10147
06:24:48,000 --> 06:24:50,040
early win that lane and then later on to

10148
06:24:50,040 --> 06:24:52,000
the game as a primal Beast you could

10149
06:24:52,000 --> 06:24:54,000
just bkb and grab the Rolling Thunder

10150
06:24:54,000 --> 06:24:56,320
ball and stop it immediately right look

10151
06:24:56,320 --> 06:24:57,798
what's waiting for him some good old

10152
06:24:57,798 --> 06:24:59,760
stacks for the mag lineup this is

10153
06:24:59,760 --> 06:25:01,840
another downside of gam not securing

10154
06:25:01,840 --> 06:25:03,200
those early team fight wins you can't

10155
06:25:03,200 --> 06:25:05,360
invade enemy side of the map this early

10156
06:25:05,360 --> 06:25:06,400
and Laurel's just going to clear through

10157
06:25:06,400 --> 06:25:09,400
it all diffusal going to help him he's

10158
06:25:09,400 --> 06:25:11,120
so big right now he's got a shield Rune

10159
06:25:11,120 --> 06:25:13,320
to boot so they're going to be looking

10160
06:25:13,320 --> 06:25:14,520
to take a fight it's also going to be

10161
06:25:14,520 --> 06:25:15,958
the blink timing for collapse he's going

10162
06:25:15,958 --> 06:25:18,718
to finish this off off the stack just

10163
06:25:18,718 --> 06:25:21,080
rush it out here look for a big blink RP

10164
06:25:21,080 --> 06:25:23,240
skew on a core continue to slow the pace

10165
06:25:23,240 --> 06:25:25,718
down here spear are going to be happy to

10166
06:25:25,718 --> 06:25:27,798
use their SS for big core kills so the

10167
06:25:27,798 --> 06:25:29,680
question on gaming side is what do you

10168
06:25:29,680 --> 06:25:31,280
do when those Els are on cool down right

10169
06:25:31,280 --> 06:25:32,680
how much can you get off the map how

10170
06:25:32,680 --> 06:25:34,040
much can you push the lanes and look for

10171
06:25:34,040 --> 06:25:36,080
kills Quinn once more looking for

10172
06:25:36,080 --> 06:25:38,240
something to get his game going here

10173
06:25:38,240 --> 06:25:40,040
just can't find anything good read by

10174
06:25:40,040 --> 06:25:42,120
moska di away into the trees there out

10175
06:25:42,120 --> 06:25:44,680
of sight from

10176
06:25:44,680 --> 06:25:47,160
Quinn and as a result that's going to be

10177
06:25:47,160 --> 06:25:49,360
yet another rotation that fails one way

10178
06:25:49,360 --> 06:25:51,000
or another gaming Gladiators whether

10179
06:25:51,000 --> 06:25:53,120
it's running into a five stack of Team

10180
06:25:53,120 --> 06:25:55,120
spirits and they lose the fight or the

10181
06:25:55,120 --> 06:25:57,120
Smoke's just not working out for them so

10182
06:25:57,120 --> 06:25:58,920
much of their early aggression with this

10183
06:25:58,920 --> 06:26:01,040
Primal Beast has been completely SED and

10184
06:26:01,040 --> 06:26:03,920
now team Spirits are sitting in a pretty

10185
06:26:03,920 --> 06:26:05,958
happy position I would say the net worth

10186
06:26:05,958 --> 06:26:08,360
is dead even but it does feel like team

10187
06:26:08,360 --> 06:26:10,160
spirit have answered gaming Gladiators

10188
06:26:10,160 --> 06:26:11,478
in all the moves they wanted to make

10189
06:26:11,478 --> 06:26:13,080
early I mean there's a lot of Magnus

10190
06:26:13,080 --> 06:26:14,798
teams over the history T I think all of

10191
06:26:14,798 --> 06:26:16,840
them will say if you are even at the

10192
06:26:16,840 --> 06:26:19,240
15-minute Mark with a MAG lineup you're

10193
06:26:19,240 --> 06:26:20,878
winning the game like you're happy cuz

10194
06:26:20,878 --> 06:26:21,878
you know this game is going to get

10195
06:26:21,878 --> 06:26:23,000
extended you're going to out Farm the

10196
06:26:23,000 --> 06:26:24,798
enemy you're going to in the outscale

10197
06:26:24,798 --> 06:26:26,558
him now a lot can happen in those fights

10198
06:26:26,558 --> 06:26:28,040
and this lineup from gaming can scale

10199
06:26:28,040 --> 06:26:30,320
very hard we've seen Primal Beast go

10200
06:26:30,320 --> 06:26:32,478
very deep in these later

10201
06:26:32,478 --> 06:26:34,878
games follow up silence

10202
06:26:34,878 --> 06:26:37,400
Heroes that can also happen yeah this is

10203
06:26:37,400 --> 06:26:38,840
the move the game of Gladiators they

10204
06:26:38,840 --> 06:26:40,080
they were trying to play off this being

10205
06:26:40,080 --> 06:26:41,600
able to get numbers movement right like

10206
06:26:41,600 --> 06:26:44,000
the Primal Beast and the Nature's profit

10207
06:26:44,000 --> 06:26:46,400
offer so much Mobility around the map

10208
06:26:46,400 --> 06:26:48,040
they should be able to outnumber team

10209
06:26:48,040 --> 06:26:50,558
spirit and find openings like that it's

10210
06:26:50,558 --> 06:26:52,320
what Cel wants to do for sure every time

10211
06:26:52,320 --> 06:26:53,280
you get one of these pickoffs with the

10212
06:26:53,280 --> 06:26:54,520
fear on you get to farm their side of

10213
06:26:54,520 --> 06:26:56,280
the map you get deep Wards up it's going

10214
06:26:56,280 --> 06:26:58,520
to set up for your next play and then

10215
06:26:58,520 --> 06:27:00,798
your econom is just going to explode and

10216
06:27:00,798 --> 06:27:02,040
you get some extra items on this fear

10217
06:27:02,040 --> 06:27:03,760
and he can control the fight the a very

10218
06:27:03,760 --> 06:27:05,200
good this game with the Roo and disarm

10219
06:27:05,200 --> 06:27:07,600
right this is a great fury on a game

10220
06:27:07,600 --> 06:27:09,200
nature is going to do some mad work here

10221
06:27:09,200 --> 06:27:10,760
if he can get anything else to help his

10222
06:27:10,760 --> 06:27:13,760
team survive in the Chrono in the RP Cel

10223
06:27:13,760 --> 06:27:14,878
is going to be a force to be reckoned

10224
06:27:14,878 --> 06:27:16,520
with and he can continue to shove these

10225
06:27:16,520 --> 06:27:19,200
waves in as well as Spirit continu to

10226
06:27:19,200 --> 06:27:20,958
play this game slow continue to farm up

10227
06:27:20,958 --> 06:27:23,558
Laurel with their Empower going to

10228
06:27:23,558 --> 06:27:25,718
work but that is a successful move for

10229
06:27:25,718 --> 06:27:27,638
gaming and a period where collaps didn't

10230
06:27:27,638 --> 06:27:30,520
really find that opening with the

10231
06:27:30,520 --> 06:27:35,638
blink we'll have to settle for some Farm

10232
06:27:36,000 --> 06:27:37,878
find an interesting note there just no

10233
06:27:37,878 --> 06:27:41,040
hand amidases in this game wraith King

10234
06:27:41,040 --> 06:27:42,638
Faceless Void both Heroes that have

10235
06:27:42,638 --> 06:27:44,000
bought it throughout this tournament

10236
06:27:44,000 --> 06:27:45,840
sometimes but feels like as the

10237
06:27:45,840 --> 06:27:47,200
tournament's gone on particularly

10238
06:27:47,200 --> 06:27:48,600
probably because the way the game of

10239
06:27:48,600 --> 06:27:49,920
Gladiators has stomped through some

10240
06:27:49,920 --> 06:27:52,080
games their are teams who've been a bit

10241
06:27:52,080 --> 06:27:54,958
wary about picking up that greedy item I

10242
06:27:54,958 --> 06:27:56,600
mean Midas is a crutch item let's be

10243
06:27:56,600 --> 06:27:58,718
honest M Midas is an item for you know

10244
06:27:58,718 --> 06:28:00,840
the bottom 14 teams it's not really a

10245
06:28:00,840 --> 06:28:03,280
grand finals item you know you got to if

10246
06:28:03,280 --> 06:28:05,320
you're worthy of a true Pantheon and you

10247
06:28:05,320 --> 06:28:06,798
don't need the extra GPM you're going to

10248
06:28:06,798 --> 06:28:08,478
collect it off your enemies

10249
06:28:08,478 --> 06:28:12,360
here see can can do that he's still

10250
06:28:12,360 --> 06:28:13,638
trying to find something with this blink

10251
06:28:13,638 --> 06:28:15,160
or maybe he's just happy empowering his

10252
06:28:15,160 --> 06:28:16,320
other cores and letting them take the

10253
06:28:16,320 --> 06:28:18,680
bulk of the net worth yoro still pretty

10254
06:28:18,680 --> 06:28:20,080
much untouched during this period just

10255
06:28:20,080 --> 06:28:22,320
going Mas Manus into the melstrom and

10256
06:28:22,320 --> 06:28:24,600
Power on top of it I mean this void is

10257
06:28:24,600 --> 06:28:26,120
going to keep up and farm even with a

10258
06:28:26,120 --> 06:28:28,920
Radiance Skeleton King am I allowed to

10259
06:28:28,920 --> 06:28:30,958
say that farming up the entire

10260
06:28:30,958 --> 06:28:34,240
map he will match him oh laurl is

10261
06:28:34,240 --> 06:28:36,520
essentially there they grab him mea can

10262
06:28:36,520 --> 06:28:38,160
stop some of this though throws out in

10263
06:28:38,160 --> 06:28:40,478
silent thinks well oh so much burst

10264
06:28:40,478 --> 06:28:41,840
damage though zeler hit him big with

10265
06:28:41,840 --> 06:28:43,240
that one he got off the shield crash

10266
06:28:43,240 --> 06:28:45,000
though and those Shields are keeping him

10267
06:28:45,000 --> 06:28:46,760
alive they need a bit more damage but

10268
06:28:46,760 --> 06:28:49,680
now he's deeping away

10269
06:28:49,680 --> 06:28:53,160
goodbye oh no gaming Gladiators got to

10270
06:28:53,160 --> 06:28:55,798
feel so bad about that a pickoff on

10271
06:28:55,798 --> 06:28:57,478
Laurel the highest net worth in this

10272
06:28:57,478 --> 06:29:00,600
game would been a dream opening for them

10273
06:29:00,600 --> 06:29:02,520
and that was one of the few openings

10274
06:29:02,520 --> 06:29:04,160
you'll have against this guy because he

10275
06:29:04,160 --> 06:29:06,520
closing in on the Lincoln fast just not

10276
06:29:06,520 --> 06:29:08,558
crisp enough La walks it off I think he

10277
06:29:08,558 --> 06:29:10,360
even misclicked his swashbuckle there

10278
06:29:10,360 --> 06:29:13,638
Dano on the edge of the Chronos sphere

10279
06:29:13,638 --> 06:29:16,520
now that's an idea team spirit said oh

10280
06:29:16,520 --> 06:29:18,400
used all those resources bottom Lane huh

10281
06:29:18,400 --> 06:29:20,520
it'd be a shame if your car got picked

10282
06:29:20,520 --> 06:29:21,718
off wouldn't

10283
06:29:21,718 --> 06:29:24,958
it a heavy cost indeed to missing this

10284
06:29:24,958 --> 06:29:27,520
gank as lurl just plays with his food

10285
06:29:27,520 --> 06:29:29,558
and they're going to put those SS to use

10286
06:29:29,558 --> 06:29:31,840
on Daio every time anytime you can just

10287
06:29:31,840 --> 06:29:33,320
collect the morphle in this game you're

10288
06:29:33,320 --> 06:29:35,440
super happy about about Itor will just

10289
06:29:35,440 --> 06:29:36,840
continue to farm says give me the

10290
06:29:36,840 --> 06:29:39,000
freebie and back to the Jungle it's

10291
06:29:39,000 --> 06:29:40,680
coming down to Ace right now right I

10292
06:29:40,680 --> 06:29:42,320
mean it feels like it comes down to Ace

10293
06:29:42,320 --> 06:29:44,280
in a lot of game games but yeah

10294
06:29:44,280 --> 06:29:45,440
particularly right now he's the

10295
06:29:45,440 --> 06:29:47,080
strongest her on the map he can create

10296
06:29:47,080 --> 06:29:48,478
the pressure he can do things like this

10297
06:29:48,478 --> 06:29:51,000
where just solo create an opportunity

10298
06:29:51,000 --> 06:29:53,000
they're going to find both

10299
06:29:53,000 --> 06:29:55,840
supports will walk it off yeah he's got

10300
06:29:55,840 --> 06:29:58,000
it back away he showed so many Heroes up

10301
06:29:58,000 --> 06:30:00,320
there killing moska earlier moska again

10302
06:30:00,320 --> 06:30:01,878
continued to play very aggressively I

10303
06:30:01,878 --> 06:30:03,520
mean the train protector he was on

10304
06:30:03,520 --> 06:30:04,920
gaming glass Gladiator side of the map

10305
06:30:04,920 --> 06:30:06,798
all the time because he was invisible

10306
06:30:06,798 --> 06:30:08,760
but this enchantress seems to have a

10307
06:30:08,760 --> 06:30:10,160
similar game plan he's going to be

10308
06:30:10,160 --> 06:30:12,680
playing up in gaming Gladiator face and

10309
06:30:12,680 --> 06:30:14,320
that does even if it costs him a death

10310
06:30:14,320 --> 06:30:16,040
every once in a while it does create

10311
06:30:16,040 --> 06:30:18,200
information and space for his cor

10312
06:30:18,200 --> 06:30:19,600
particularly when the Chrono and the RP

10313
06:30:19,600 --> 06:30:21,440
are down this is where gam can pretty

10314
06:30:21,440 --> 06:30:23,080
much Run the game of the map choose

10315
06:30:23,080 --> 06:30:24,440
which objective they want and claim it

10316
06:30:24,440 --> 06:30:25,680
for free there's no way you're fighting

10317
06:30:25,680 --> 06:30:27,200
them without those big olds all cool

10318
06:30:27,200 --> 06:30:29,320
down without collapse being stronger

10319
06:30:29,320 --> 06:30:31,600
skewer on skewer play you're coming with

10320
06:30:31,600 --> 06:30:35,240
me up into the TP point from Quinn

10321
06:30:35,240 --> 06:30:36,798
collaps as long as he keeps the damage

10322
06:30:36,798 --> 06:30:37,760
on him he's not going to be able to

10323
06:30:37,760 --> 06:30:40,320
Blink away and Quinn will finish the job

10324
06:30:40,320 --> 06:30:42,478
great move from gerio those are the kind

10325
06:30:42,478 --> 06:30:44,398
of plays you need to see here if you

10326
06:30:44,398 --> 06:30:46,520
want to be able to take down the best

10327
06:30:46,520 --> 06:30:48,958
team at this tournament you need to be

10328
06:30:48,958 --> 06:30:50,958
able to pull off some solar moves like

10329
06:30:50,958 --> 06:30:52,200
that and create the pressure that's

10330
06:30:52,200 --> 06:30:53,478
going to create openings elsewhere and

10331
06:30:53,478 --> 06:30:55,520
suddenly toio this stolen power is

10332
06:30:55,520 --> 06:30:57,360
pretty damn nice he can throw it on the

10333
06:30:57,360 --> 06:30:58,920
ra King he can throw it on the Primal

10334
06:30:58,920 --> 06:31:01,160
especially bonus damage on Primal Quinn

10335
06:31:01,160 --> 06:31:02,920
is going to be very happy with that that

10336
06:31:02,920 --> 06:31:04,120
is something we can see in a lot of

10337
06:31:04,120 --> 06:31:05,200
these fights probably going to be the

10338
06:31:05,200 --> 06:31:07,080
best steal for Dau out side of maybe

10339
06:31:07,080 --> 06:31:08,878
time dilation throwing back against team

10340
06:31:08,878 --> 06:31:10,520
spirit or just creating his own

10341
06:31:10,520 --> 06:31:12,398
grimstroke

10342
06:31:12,398 --> 06:31:14,398
combination these are good morphling

10343
06:31:14,398 --> 06:31:16,120
combos he can use for the fights and the

10344
06:31:16,120 --> 06:31:18,080
team Quinn starting to pick up the pace

10345
06:31:18,080 --> 06:31:20,360
and instantly silenced and Beautiful

10346
06:31:20,360 --> 06:31:22,040
Soul bite and now it ink swell up

10347
06:31:22,040 --> 06:31:23,920
pinball coming through Straight to the

10348
06:31:23,920 --> 06:31:25,680
heart of gaming Gladiators Dau is

10349
06:31:25,680 --> 06:31:27,320
already burned out of most of his Mana

10350
06:31:27,320 --> 06:31:29,320
pops his wand but Daio he needs to be

10351
06:31:29,320 --> 06:31:31,440
able to get away from both and yoro and

10352
06:31:31,440 --> 06:31:33,160
he's been burned out no chance there

10353
06:31:33,160 --> 06:31:34,398
game Gladiator still have a chance

10354
06:31:34,398 --> 06:31:35,478
though would be able to fight back

10355
06:31:35,478 --> 06:31:38,478
around ace in his Radiance but without

10356
06:31:38,478 --> 06:31:40,120
their carry it's not looking great is

10357
06:31:40,120 --> 06:31:42,600
Ace going to be burned out of his first

10358
06:31:42,600 --> 06:31:44,718
life can they fight around this second

10359
06:31:44,718 --> 06:31:46,240
one Quinn sticking around they certainly

10360
06:31:46,240 --> 06:31:48,120
don't want to be given up Ace like this

10361
06:31:48,120 --> 06:31:50,558
fear shot back coming up at 2 seconds

10362
06:31:50,558 --> 06:31:53,120
here yeah yoro says my cool Down's back

10363
06:31:53,120 --> 06:31:54,280
can push

10364
06:31:54,280 --> 06:31:58,120
this just not enough reach not necessary

10365
06:31:58,120 --> 06:31:59,920
really for team spirit right no no

10366
06:31:59,920 --> 06:32:01,798
reason to give them an opportunity like

10367
06:32:01,798 --> 06:32:05,080
that he could stretch out claim all of

10368
06:32:05,080 --> 06:32:07,040
this map space you've just fought for

10369
06:32:07,040 --> 06:32:10,000
and farm away now I do think this late

10370
06:32:10,000 --> 06:32:12,718
game is not 100% right we're talking

10371
06:32:12,718 --> 06:32:15,600
about mag void it is very powerful

10372
06:32:15,600 --> 06:32:16,760
you're going to get some pickoffs like

10373
06:32:16,760 --> 06:32:18,280
this for sure and Empower is going to

10374
06:32:18,280 --> 06:32:20,240
clean up the map but there's like some

10375
06:32:20,240 --> 06:32:21,600
weird things that can happen with raai

10376
06:32:21,600 --> 06:32:22,878
King a there there's some weird things

10377
06:32:22,878 --> 06:32:24,558
that happen if theu gets a free angle in

10378
06:32:24,558 --> 06:32:25,798
the fight and can like clean up the

10379
06:32:25,798 --> 06:32:27,558
backline with morling first and power

10380
06:32:27,558 --> 06:32:30,160
himself you know grimstroke SW himself

10381
06:32:30,160 --> 06:32:32,440
yep it's going to be tier one down in

10382
06:32:32,440 --> 06:32:34,878
the bottom Lane as Laurel marches

10383
06:32:34,878 --> 06:32:37,240
forward confidently with his lincol

10384
06:32:37,240 --> 06:32:39,280
because what's really going to catch him

10385
06:32:39,280 --> 06:32:40,478
it feels like he's most of the time

10386
06:32:40,478 --> 06:32:41,798
going to have a chance to be able to

10387
06:32:41,798 --> 06:32:43,840
escape if gaming Gladiators ever try and

10388
06:32:43,840 --> 06:32:46,120
jump him here it's a really fast Lincoln

10389
06:32:46,120 --> 06:32:49,680
as well this is mag Pango in its prime I

10390
06:32:49,680 --> 06:32:50,958
think a hero that is not afraid to fight

10391
06:32:50,958 --> 06:32:52,558
off cool they're really going toy the

10392
06:32:52,558 --> 06:32:54,360
Tormentor right in front of gaming

10393
06:32:54,360 --> 06:32:56,878
gladiator's base that is crazy but they

10394
06:32:56,878 --> 06:32:58,760
just did it four Heroes that's all they

10395
06:32:58,760 --> 06:33:01,320
needed meanwhile celery being G on by

10396
06:33:01,320 --> 06:33:03,798
utoro he just gets a bit of a poke gets

10397
06:33:03,798 --> 06:33:05,240
reaction out of gaming Gladiators Ace

10398
06:33:05,240 --> 06:33:07,040
will try and punish him but just no

10399
06:33:07,040 --> 06:33:09,440
followup yeah he needs a lot more celer

10400
06:33:09,440 --> 06:33:11,398
is going to try and Chase up the TPS are

10401
06:33:11,398 --> 06:33:12,718
coming in here tries to block him out

10402
06:33:12,718 --> 06:33:14,958
with the Sprout but yoro is running free

10403
06:33:14,958 --> 06:33:16,638
Dao chases after him gets him with the

10404
06:33:16,638 --> 06:33:19,120
time dilation though but it is a very

10405
06:33:19,120 --> 06:33:21,440
very CL from tachio but he gets it he

10406
06:33:21,440 --> 06:33:23,360
gets that kill now turns back around on

10407
06:33:23,360 --> 06:33:25,718
the collapse oh RP right in front of

10408
06:33:25,718 --> 06:33:27,520
that tier two but silenced up just in

10409
06:33:27,520 --> 06:33:29,878
the nick of time before his secur he

10410
06:33:29,878 --> 06:33:31,958
wants more yeah he does he sees this

10411
06:33:31,958 --> 06:33:34,320
opportunity what a beautiful entrance

10412
06:33:34,320 --> 06:33:36,680
from Daio into this game that is the

10413
06:33:36,680 --> 06:33:38,520
power of stolen time dilation plus the

10414
06:33:38,520 --> 06:33:40,878
time walk right infinite Chase potential

10415
06:33:40,878 --> 06:33:42,958
suddenly faceless vo can't do the same

10416
06:33:42,958 --> 06:33:45,000
back and Dao says two can play at that

10417
06:33:45,000 --> 06:33:46,878
game yoro I can get aggressive too and

10418
06:33:46,878 --> 06:33:48,760
make it work just creates an opening out

10419
06:33:48,760 --> 06:33:50,920
of nothing there off a chase that felt

10420
06:33:50,920 --> 06:33:52,200
you know like what is Ace doing here

10421
06:33:52,200 --> 06:33:54,718
he's wasting his time not at all

10422
06:33:54,718 --> 06:33:56,040
everything coming together going to

10423
06:33:56,040 --> 06:33:58,360
propel celery up that board as well

10424
06:33:58,360 --> 06:34:00,160
imagine you have that a Wrath of nature

10425
06:34:00,160 --> 06:34:01,840
here right suddenly chases like this

10426
06:34:01,840 --> 06:34:04,638
become a lot easier oh yeah and yoro

10427
06:34:04,638 --> 06:34:05,878
he's just still looking for that big

10428
06:34:05,878 --> 06:34:07,558
dispel item his choice will be Mana

10429
06:34:07,558 --> 06:34:10,878
first over the bkb but until that's outu

10430
06:34:10,878 --> 06:34:12,798
has decent opening in these fights and

10431
06:34:12,798 --> 06:34:15,160
you got the RP out of that yeah it

10432
06:34:15,160 --> 06:34:16,878
actually just leads gaming Gladiators

10433
06:34:16,878 --> 06:34:20,040
into more opportunities

10434
06:34:20,040 --> 06:34:23,478
perhaps that a finished for celery if he

10435
06:34:23,478 --> 06:34:25,878
can fly it out okay that is something

10436
06:34:25,878 --> 06:34:27,040
that can bounce through lock these

10437
06:34:27,040 --> 06:34:28,760
Heroes down create more openings for the

10438
06:34:28,760 --> 06:34:31,200
r King Primal to just get in there and

10439
06:34:31,200 --> 06:34:33,360
set up that front line Second Tormentor

10440
06:34:33,360 --> 06:34:37,160
will go team spirit's Way With A

10441
06:34:37,160 --> 06:34:40,478
Shard so now they've got a Shard on both

10442
06:34:40,478 --> 06:34:41,920
of their

10443
06:34:41,920 --> 06:34:43,878
supports that's pretty funny I think

10444
06:34:43,878 --> 06:34:46,360
that the miror one grimstroke that's so

10445
06:34:46,360 --> 06:34:48,320
much better for them hard dispel to be

10446
06:34:48,320 --> 06:34:50,600
able to help save this Pango or this

10447
06:34:50,600 --> 06:34:52,958
Faceless Void when they need it most but

10448
06:34:52,958 --> 06:34:54,558
maybe there's just too much Firepower

10449
06:34:54,558 --> 06:34:56,398
some of these times as we can see from

10450
06:34:56,398 --> 06:34:58,040
gaming Gladiators when their cor start

10451
06:34:58,040 --> 06:34:59,280
linking up and they're picking up the

10452
06:34:59,280 --> 06:35:01,760
pace now Daio he's just swarming forward

10453
06:35:01,760 --> 06:35:03,120
seeing if there's anybody else to be

10454
06:35:03,120 --> 06:35:04,200
able to catch

10455
06:35:04,200 --> 06:35:06,600
deep on team spirit side of the map and

10456
06:35:06,600 --> 06:35:08,120
this is the part where team spirit needs

10457
06:35:08,120 --> 06:35:09,718
to be able to slow down the game the

10458
06:35:09,718 --> 06:35:11,360
momentum is beginning to play against

10459
06:35:11,360 --> 06:35:13,240
them this is where the map becomes

10460
06:35:13,240 --> 06:35:15,120
difficult you have skeleton shoving in

10461
06:35:15,120 --> 06:35:16,398
one wave you have wrath and nature

10462
06:35:16,398 --> 06:35:18,040
pushing all the lanes the morphling is

10463
06:35:18,040 --> 06:35:19,240
not afraid to show right now he has

10464
06:35:19,240 --> 06:35:21,440
manions on top of it and the Primal if

10465
06:35:21,440 --> 06:35:22,878
he's in the fog it creates a scary

10466
06:35:22,878 --> 06:35:25,000
situation with the pickoff potential

10467
06:35:25,000 --> 06:35:26,520
they're just getting more information

10468
06:35:26,520 --> 06:35:27,920
than team spirit right now there are

10469
06:35:27,920 --> 06:35:30,440
still very deep Observer WS them a

10470
06:35:30,440 --> 06:35:31,878
potion got out but you can't really get

10471
06:35:31,878 --> 06:35:33,120
there and use them and they're not

10472
06:35:33,120 --> 06:35:35,680
scouting any right now is every's on top

10473
06:35:35,680 --> 06:35:37,878
of him that uh that Shard is pretty

10474
06:35:37,878 --> 06:35:40,398
helpful when it comes to the Sprouts but

10475
06:35:40,398 --> 06:35:42,398
it may not save him from this he's going

10476
06:35:42,398 --> 06:35:44,718
to be surrounded he'll create a little

10477
06:35:44,718 --> 06:35:46,200
bit more time a little bit more space in

10478
06:35:46,200 --> 06:35:47,878
fact he's going to go for the TP away

10479
06:35:47,878 --> 06:35:50,000
and there it is okay they do managed to

10480
06:35:50,000 --> 06:35:51,958
stop that that would have hurt gaming

10481
06:35:51,958 --> 06:35:53,680
Gladiators a lot if they let him get

10482
06:35:53,680 --> 06:35:56,360
away from that solid space I'm sure is

10483
06:35:56,360 --> 06:35:58,638
what he'll say yeah absolutely time to

10484
06:35:58,638 --> 06:36:00,718
try and get to the dispel item on yoro

10485
06:36:00,718 --> 06:36:02,320
as collapse will finish

10486
06:36:02,320 --> 06:36:04,558
Harpoon so he can't really deal with

10487
06:36:04,558 --> 06:36:05,840
time dilation in the fight if it comes

10488
06:36:05,840 --> 06:36:07,600
out it's a very aggressive item he can

10489
06:36:07,600 --> 06:36:09,320
lock people down guarantee the skewer

10490
06:36:09,320 --> 06:36:11,798
better but if the fight starts on him

10491
06:36:11,798 --> 06:36:13,878
could backfire and Quinn's still working

10492
06:36:13,878 --> 06:36:14,958
towards that

10493
06:36:14,958 --> 06:36:18,000
heart so gam looking for the next big

10494
06:36:18,000 --> 06:36:19,200
damage items that are going to let them

10495
06:36:19,200 --> 06:36:21,558
ramp this game up and of course Ace

10496
06:36:21,558 --> 06:36:24,718
still sitting top at fretty here he's

10497
06:36:24,718 --> 06:36:26,240
the big objective driver so if he

10498
06:36:26,240 --> 06:36:28,120
decides that they need to force tier two

10499
06:36:28,120 --> 06:36:29,840
go for Roshan where they want to watch

10500
06:36:29,840 --> 06:36:31,760
fight and how it's up to Ace right now

10501
06:36:31,760 --> 06:36:34,240
as he is the front line calling for a

10502
06:36:34,240 --> 06:36:37,200
smoke looking for some kind of pick off

10503
06:36:37,200 --> 06:36:39,398
here the right kind of opening they

10504
06:36:39,398 --> 06:36:41,760
could translate this into a quick roast

10505
06:36:41,760 --> 06:36:43,760
T exactly they're looking at the corner

10506
06:36:43,760 --> 06:36:45,558
of the map so anybody that dies down

10507
06:36:45,558 --> 06:36:47,000
here yor is instantly going to go in the

10508
06:36:47,000 --> 06:36:49,398
pit he might just do it anyway yeah

10509
06:36:49,398 --> 06:36:51,160
gaming Gladiators say they look inside

10510
06:36:51,160 --> 06:36:53,638
see if it's actually gam who's taking

10511
06:36:53,638 --> 06:36:56,000
that ran that's going to be pretty tough

10512
06:36:56,000 --> 06:36:58,080
to deal with you Toro with that Shard

10513
06:36:58,080 --> 06:36:59,840
jumping around with ink swell on top of

10514
06:36:59,840 --> 06:37:01,638
him so even if you catch him Midway

10515
06:37:01,638 --> 06:37:03,040
through his time walk and stop him from

10516
06:37:03,040 --> 06:37:05,120
leaping back back into play there is

10517
06:37:05,120 --> 06:37:07,320
that disbel that can come out that's why

10518
06:37:07,320 --> 06:37:09,760
you want to create a situation where he

10519
06:37:09,760 --> 06:37:11,160
has to choose between Chrono in the

10520
06:37:11,160 --> 06:37:13,080
front line in the heart Primal or you

10521
06:37:13,080 --> 06:37:14,798
know the ra King with two lives oh if

10522
06:37:14,798 --> 06:37:16,398
they make this move fast enough it could

10523
06:37:16,398 --> 06:37:18,000
be massive for gaming Gladiators they

10524
06:37:18,000 --> 06:37:19,638
have a double damage in more flings

10525
06:37:19,638 --> 06:37:22,718
bottle and taking to this fight in time

10526
06:37:22,718 --> 06:37:26,040
team spirit may get wiped and lose the

10527
06:37:26,040 --> 06:37:27,600
Roshan fight and they are not doing this

10528
06:37:27,600 --> 06:37:29,120
fast enough gaming Gladiators are going

10529
06:37:29,120 --> 06:37:30,040
to get here and it looks like team

10530
06:37:30,040 --> 06:37:31,200
spirit have made the right Le they're

10531
06:37:31,200 --> 06:37:32,878
going to smoke backing themselves away

10532
06:37:32,878 --> 06:37:34,600
see if they can fin the opening on

10533
06:37:34,600 --> 06:37:36,240
gaming

10534
06:37:36,240 --> 06:37:38,200
Gladiator on The High Ground bkb

10535
06:37:38,200 --> 06:37:39,558
immediately goes out now he has to turn

10536
06:37:39,558 --> 06:37:41,280
and Chase but he's not going to be close

10537
06:37:41,280 --> 06:37:43,000
enough team spirit got something big out

10538
06:37:43,000 --> 06:37:45,080
of they do that's going to be able to

10539
06:37:45,080 --> 06:37:46,958
hit all those Heroes the RP do lock down

10540
06:37:46,958 --> 06:37:49,600
the two Heroes they jumped into the RP

10541
06:37:49,600 --> 06:37:51,718
dato dies immediately going to have to

10542
06:37:51,718 --> 06:37:53,080
do all the damage from here on out but

10543
06:37:53,080 --> 06:37:54,320
the Rolling Thunder is dangerous and

10544
06:37:54,320 --> 06:37:55,520
slows him down with the bashes and the

10545
06:37:55,520 --> 06:37:57,360
Rolling Thunder hits and there's no

10546
06:37:57,360 --> 06:37:59,718
chance and now they leave Quinn yeah

10547
06:37:59,718 --> 06:38:01,600
trap him inside that chronosphere his

10548
06:38:01,600 --> 06:38:05,360
bkb is gone get the rest oh it's gameing

10549
06:38:05,360 --> 06:38:07,600
Gladiators who had an opportunity there

10550
06:38:07,600 --> 06:38:12,440
to be able to upset but now just what

10551
06:38:12,440 --> 06:38:14,760
they feared the most which was losing a

10552
06:38:14,760 --> 06:38:17,360
fight and giving the ran to team spirit

10553
06:38:17,360 --> 06:38:19,240
that may have just occurred it's going

10554
06:38:19,240 --> 06:38:20,520
to switch the side so they're going to

10555
06:38:20,520 --> 06:38:22,080
have to run up top they might not have

10556
06:38:22,080 --> 06:38:23,558
enough time before gaming respond I mean

10557
06:38:23,558 --> 06:38:24,760
you got to remember they can TP to this

10558
06:38:24,760 --> 06:38:26,160
dire Outpost up here as well if they

10559
06:38:26,160 --> 06:38:28,000
still have off cool down but damn what a

10560
06:38:28,000 --> 06:38:30,120
heads up RP from collapse that is a team

10561
06:38:30,120 --> 06:38:32,360
fight salvaging RP as the wrath of

10562
06:38:32,360 --> 06:38:34,680
nature just got him all on the backside

10563
06:38:34,680 --> 06:38:36,760
and dilation was thrown out early here

10564
06:38:36,760 --> 06:38:38,280
so right there it goes on Quinn but that

10565
06:38:38,280 --> 06:38:40,440
opens the fight for Daio by a decent

10566
06:38:40,440 --> 06:38:42,718
margin just didn't I don't know I mean

10567
06:38:42,718 --> 06:38:44,840
he just RPD him there's no way around it

10568
06:38:44,840 --> 06:38:46,920
yeah they only had one stun to work with

10569
06:38:46,920 --> 06:38:49,520
Dao just makes a complete misread of the

10570
06:38:49,520 --> 06:38:51,558
situation there maybe thought the stun

10571
06:38:51,558 --> 06:38:53,920
was going to latch and be longer but

10572
06:38:53,920 --> 06:38:55,200
there's a lot of bailout here in the

10573
06:38:55,200 --> 06:38:56,600
second that goes wrong on the morphling

10574
06:38:56,600 --> 06:38:58,280
this fight is just completely over yoro

10575
06:38:58,280 --> 06:39:00,160
is going to clean house you cannot give

10576
06:39:00,160 --> 06:39:01,760
too many of these openings upside though

10577
06:39:01,760 --> 06:39:04,718
like we said is this Ro on switch sides

10578
06:39:04,718 --> 06:39:06,478
and the respawn timers were not too long

10579
06:39:06,478 --> 06:39:09,160
here so dire side going to work for G as

10580
06:39:09,160 --> 06:39:10,798
they come back into this map and stall

10581
06:39:10,798 --> 06:39:13,040
out the RO a second time I think you

10582
06:39:13,040 --> 06:39:14,478
just man up for it here because you know

10583
06:39:14,478 --> 06:39:17,440
RP and krono are on cool down yeah 100%

10584
06:39:17,440 --> 06:39:19,120
And team spirit I mean it would be a

10585
06:39:19,120 --> 06:39:21,120
pretty bold move to try and take this

10586
06:39:21,120 --> 06:39:23,120
fight without their ultimates no they're

10587
06:39:23,120 --> 06:39:25,040
just looking for the pickoff they not

10588
06:39:25,040 --> 06:39:26,638
going to find it clear the wave but this

10589
06:39:26,638 --> 06:39:28,718
contest it's all on Lael with the

10590
06:39:28,718 --> 06:39:30,440
Rolling Thunder maybe they can take the

10591
06:39:30,440 --> 06:39:32,320
afterwards he's thinking about going in

10592
06:39:32,320 --> 06:39:34,000
with this in well he tries jump in see

10593
06:39:34,000 --> 06:39:36,040
if they can get the skewer pickoff no

10594
06:39:36,040 --> 06:39:38,638
such luck gaming Gladiators Retreat very

10595
06:39:38,638 --> 06:39:40,760
defensively after claiming that agis

10596
06:39:40,760 --> 06:39:42,840
they know team spirit are bold enough to

10597
06:39:42,840 --> 06:39:45,160
make a move like that they respect

10598
06:39:45,160 --> 06:39:48,600
it now'll back away Daio they'll try and

10599
06:39:48,600 --> 06:39:50,600
get his farm into the silver Edge which

10600
06:39:50,600 --> 06:39:52,040
is a great way to be able to find some

10601
06:39:52,040 --> 06:39:53,558
of those backline Heroes I mean I think

10602
06:39:53,558 --> 06:39:55,798
that that grimstroke is a big problem

10603
06:39:55,798 --> 06:39:58,200
for them it is the link and the dispel

10604
06:39:58,200 --> 06:39:59,878
off the swell are both really nice here

10605
06:39:59,878 --> 06:40:01,958
especially when you just throw the cell

10606
06:40:01,958 --> 06:40:03,798
onto the Faceless Void or the Magnus

10607
06:40:03,798 --> 06:40:05,240
they get a free jump and if they get

10608
06:40:05,240 --> 06:40:06,798
stun you just bail them out right I

10609
06:40:06,798 --> 06:40:07,718
think we're going to see that the whole

10610
06:40:07,718 --> 06:40:09,478
game it's going to make sure that both

10611
06:40:09,478 --> 06:40:11,840
collaps andoro can hold their bkbs or

10612
06:40:11,840 --> 06:40:13,520
the mantha for as long as they want here

10613
06:40:13,520 --> 06:40:15,440
and Mira can bail them out of course you

10614
06:40:15,440 --> 06:40:16,638
can also just throw it on the Pango and

10615
06:40:16,638 --> 06:40:18,320
let him roll in yeah speaking of the

10616
06:40:18,320 --> 06:40:20,240
Pango his item timing was definitely

10617
06:40:20,240 --> 06:40:22,080
delayed quite a bit but he's finally

10618
06:40:22,080 --> 06:40:23,680
going to get there he got that Lincoln a

10619
06:40:23,680 --> 06:40:25,478
while ago but the agony scepter that he

10620
06:40:25,478 --> 06:40:27,600
was looking for next will finally be

10621
06:40:27,600 --> 06:40:30,200
complete hurricane Pike for moska so the

10622
06:40:30,200 --> 06:40:31,638
damage starting to heat up here for

10623
06:40:31,638 --> 06:40:33,360
Spirit as they're going to spread it AC

10624
06:40:33,360 --> 06:40:35,600
Cross Four effective cores going into

10625
06:40:35,600 --> 06:40:36,878
this late game that is why they love the

10626
06:40:36,878 --> 06:40:39,280
enchantress mka is going to start to

10627
06:40:39,280 --> 06:40:42,000
cause his own Mischief in the fight and

10628
06:40:42,000 --> 06:40:43,280
that pushes the question back to game in

10629
06:40:43,280 --> 06:40:44,638
in terms of how are you scaling in this

10630
06:40:44,638 --> 06:40:45,718
game right cuz right now you have an

10631
06:40:45,718 --> 06:40:47,478
Aegis you have a morling pushing towards

10632
06:40:47,478 --> 06:40:50,440
silver Edge a just hit his bkb timing

10633
06:40:50,440 --> 06:40:53,280
here and the heart is a couple hundred

10634
06:40:53,280 --> 06:40:55,320
off for Quinn so you have some really

10635
06:40:55,320 --> 06:40:57,600
strong fighting items coming out all in

10636
06:40:57,600 --> 06:40:58,920
the same interval here for gaming you

10637
06:40:58,920 --> 06:41:00,478
would really like a good team fight out

10638
06:41:00,478 --> 06:41:02,878
of this especially if the Chrono the RP

10639
06:41:02,878 --> 06:41:04,320
gets

10640
06:41:04,320 --> 06:41:06,040
or if you trade an AIS for it you might

10641
06:41:06,040 --> 06:41:07,718
be okay with that in the long run you

10642
06:41:07,718 --> 06:41:09,120
can at least find something on the back

10643
06:41:09,120 --> 06:41:11,398
side cuz right now you're looking at

10644
06:41:11,398 --> 06:41:14,398
yoro he has a mantha that's it he did

10645
06:41:14,398 --> 06:41:16,200
not go for bkb on the face of boy this

10646
06:41:16,200 --> 06:41:18,718
game he's just hyping up the damage here

10647
06:41:18,718 --> 06:41:20,558
abusing the fact he has a power going to

10648
06:41:20,558 --> 06:41:22,280
go for a later Lincoln sphere but it

10649
06:41:22,280 --> 06:41:24,638
will be collapsed with that bkb so it's

10650
06:41:24,638 --> 06:41:25,920
a question of who do you want to start

10651
06:41:25,920 --> 06:41:28,040
off and maybe the silver Edge is going

10652
06:41:28,040 --> 06:41:30,360
to give to rachio the option to put his

10653
06:41:30,360 --> 06:41:32,280
aggression to use and just start on a

10654
06:41:32,280 --> 06:41:34,558
support start on a cor give the vision

10655
06:41:34,558 --> 06:41:36,958
for a r King jump Vision means

10656
06:41:36,958 --> 06:41:39,798
everything here for gladiators as they

10657
06:41:39,798 --> 06:41:41,920
try and take these next few fights yeah

10658
06:41:41,920 --> 06:41:44,920
which means moska is a particular

10659
06:41:44,920 --> 06:41:48,000
nuisance to them as he once again leads

10660
06:41:48,000 --> 06:41:49,958
forward just using the creep to be able

10661
06:41:49,958 --> 06:41:51,398
to find information they got the har and

10662
06:41:51,398 --> 06:41:53,320
skewer back now we does have bkb locked

10663
06:41:53,320 --> 06:41:55,040
down by the RP but maybe the damage is

10664
06:41:55,040 --> 06:41:56,120
going to be enough it's going to be

10665
06:41:56,120 --> 06:41:57,840
close call Quinn starts walk it away

10666
06:41:57,840 --> 06:41:59,558
celer is going to jump in with the wrath

10667
06:41:59,558 --> 06:42:01,160
of nature soon coming out he tries to

10668
06:42:01,160 --> 06:42:02,520
use the ogre seal totem to get away from

10669
06:42:02,520 --> 06:42:04,120
the Rolling Thunder or they jump forward

10670
06:42:04,120 --> 06:42:06,080
on Daio they want to get something out

10671
06:42:06,080 --> 06:42:08,120
of this they see an opportunity surely

10672
06:42:08,120 --> 06:42:10,120
but they couldn't actually grab anybody

10673
06:42:10,120 --> 06:42:12,840
just lacking the disables glimmer C

10674
06:42:12,840 --> 06:42:14,520
posing problems for tachu as well and

10675
06:42:14,520 --> 06:42:17,040
just can't see anything to hit and team

10676
06:42:17,040 --> 06:42:19,280
spirit able to disengage after that

10677
06:42:19,280 --> 06:42:20,558
wrath of nature rooted them all which

10678
06:42:20,558 --> 06:42:22,040
means too wants to go back he's got an

10679
06:42:22,040 --> 06:42:23,520
opening here looks for it with the

10680
06:42:23,520 --> 06:42:25,120
chronosphere there were so grouped up on

10681
06:42:25,120 --> 06:42:26,398
gaming gladiators but he doesn't have

10682
06:42:26,398 --> 06:42:28,680
the vision he's now been grabbed

10683
06:42:28,680 --> 06:42:30,240
disabled they actually have that the

10684
06:42:30,240 --> 06:42:31,558
calling goes out he's on the other side

10685
06:42:31,558 --> 06:42:33,440
he actually gets away thanks well Time

10686
06:42:33,440 --> 06:42:35,600
Walk undo so much of the damage and now

10687
06:42:35,600 --> 06:42:37,120
gaming Gladiators have to play it a

10688
06:42:37,120 --> 06:42:38,920
little bit slow have to respect that

10689
06:42:38,920 --> 06:42:40,920
Soul bind they cleans themselves of the

10690
06:42:40,920 --> 06:42:42,600
ghost that silence is now gone the soul

10691
06:42:42,600 --> 06:42:45,280
bind is away he's still waiting for his

10692
06:42:45,280 --> 06:42:48,120
opportunity to get that c out two three

10693
06:42:48,120 --> 06:42:49,680
one in the back two in the front that's

10694
06:42:49,680 --> 06:42:51,000
going to be the aeges down for the

10695
06:42:51,000 --> 06:42:53,280
morling a second life for both him and

10696
06:42:53,280 --> 06:42:55,200
Ace though can yoro fight through this

10697
06:42:55,200 --> 06:42:56,478
one is he going to be able to get away

10698
06:42:56,478 --> 06:42:58,760
the shot R the entangle as well that's

10699
06:42:58,760 --> 06:43:00,520
enough they bring down the carry now for

10700
06:43:00,520 --> 06:43:02,840
the rest team spirit playing back into

10701
06:43:02,840 --> 06:43:04,958
this one one the end inks well now sker

10702
06:43:04,958 --> 06:43:06,920
locking him together Lao maybe he can

10703
06:43:06,920 --> 06:43:09,000
fight this one out Daio wave fors over

10704
06:43:09,000 --> 06:43:10,320
it trying to separate from his team a

10705
06:43:10,320 --> 06:43:11,600
little bit make sure this watch bule

10706
06:43:11,600 --> 06:43:13,600
doesn't edly decimate them like it does

10707
06:43:13,600 --> 06:43:15,440
tofu in the back lines Ace trying to

10708
06:43:15,440 --> 06:43:19,398
chase down the out but Daio dies as snor

10709
06:43:19,398 --> 06:43:21,000
he does manage to finish him off just on

10710
06:43:21,000 --> 06:43:23,840
the very tip just to be able to get that

10711
06:43:23,840 --> 06:43:25,798
kill before he falls goaps tries to skew

10712
06:43:25,798 --> 06:43:27,478
her away but locked down by quen in the

10713
06:43:27,478 --> 06:43:30,000
end cannot escape the inevitable which

10714
06:43:30,000 --> 06:43:31,840
is just too many lives on the side of

10715
06:43:31,840 --> 06:43:33,840
game and a buyback from gets another

10716
06:43:33,840 --> 06:43:35,120
Wrath of nature through that fight

10717
06:43:35,120 --> 06:43:37,240
lasted so damn long and of course you

10718
06:43:37,240 --> 06:43:40,558
had the Aegis on Daio the reincar on Ace

10719
06:43:40,558 --> 06:43:42,760
and Quinn just abusing This Heart region

10720
06:43:42,760 --> 06:43:44,320
on the back side of that fight the

10721
06:43:44,320 --> 06:43:46,478
Chrono was absolutely beautiful and you

10722
06:43:46,478 --> 06:43:50,558
say buyback on c three lives yeah game

10723
06:43:50,558 --> 06:43:52,240
of Gladiators just brought more numbers

10724
06:43:52,240 --> 06:43:53,638
than team spirit could possibly even

10725
06:43:53,638 --> 06:43:55,280
dream of it's like an eight on five here

10726
06:43:55,280 --> 06:43:56,760
right so you kill three or two and a

10727
06:43:56,760 --> 06:43:57,798
half in the Chrono you're going to take

10728
06:43:57,798 --> 06:43:59,638
Ace on the other side and they're all

10729
06:43:59,638 --> 06:44:01,478
coming back I mean that's exactly what

10730
06:44:01,478 --> 06:44:02,558
you want to use this AIS and

10731
06:44:02,558 --> 06:44:03,760
reincarnation

10732
06:44:03,760 --> 06:44:05,638
cre a situation where you set the fight

10733
06:44:05,638 --> 06:44:07,600
up towards the end the ult on cool down

10734
06:44:07,600 --> 06:44:09,240
and you just get an even Man fight and

10735
06:44:09,240 --> 06:44:10,760
that is when Daio can start to clean

10736
06:44:10,760 --> 06:44:12,760
house this morling he do some serious

10737
06:44:12,760 --> 06:44:15,000
DPS but damn were those ink swells a

10738
06:44:15,000 --> 06:44:16,398
problem they were catching so many

10739
06:44:16,398 --> 06:44:18,718
Heroes collapse gets to survive the

10740
06:44:18,718 --> 06:44:20,200
entire fight just right clicking people

10741
06:44:20,200 --> 06:44:21,520
the entire time and I thought LL was

10742
06:44:21,520 --> 06:44:23,080
maybe going to carry the end of this

10743
06:44:23,080 --> 06:44:27,000
Pango is doing so much DPS yeah but coll

10744
06:44:27,000 --> 06:44:28,478
I think saves so much of this fight

10745
06:44:28,478 --> 06:44:31,120
because if datu manag to live through it

10746
06:44:31,120 --> 06:44:33,398
then who knows how much damage they do

10747
06:44:33,398 --> 06:44:36,120
while team is dead but theing is gone

10748
06:44:36,120 --> 06:44:37,638
there goes a decent amount of their

10749
06:44:37,638 --> 06:44:40,520
pushing and threat for the ground

10750
06:44:40,520 --> 06:44:42,478
instead it's the fury gun and the

10751
06:44:42,478 --> 06:44:44,478
skeletons that push out it'll be ace who

10752
06:44:44,478 --> 06:44:45,798
collects it and this ra King is just

10753
06:44:45,798 --> 06:44:47,680
turning into a straight carry right now

10754
06:44:47,680 --> 06:44:49,200
this is not even a bad carry match up

10755
06:44:49,200 --> 06:44:51,120
vers the faces void if you have help to

10756
06:44:51,120 --> 06:44:53,280
do it just going to be an AC for Ace

10757
06:44:53,280 --> 06:44:55,600
here Shard to boot so you cannot mana

10758
06:44:55,600 --> 06:44:57,718
burn him out and he's going to be a

10759
06:44:57,718 --> 06:44:59,240
problem he's going to deal enough damage

10760
06:44:59,240 --> 06:45:00,280
create enough threat that you're going

10761
06:45:00,280 --> 06:45:01,638
to have to think about him first or at

10762
06:45:01,638 --> 06:45:03,638
least maybe skewer him in deep take him

10763
06:45:03,638 --> 06:45:05,718
out for free and think about when you

10764
06:45:05,718 --> 06:45:07,558
commit the cron or the RP cuz it's not

10765
06:45:07,558 --> 06:45:09,600
so straightforward anymore you can play

10766
06:45:09,600 --> 06:45:12,040
off some pangle or pokes

10767
06:45:12,040 --> 06:45:14,080
but the damage in the front Line's

10768
06:45:14,080 --> 06:45:15,680
coming through for gaman right now and a

10769
06:45:15,680 --> 06:45:17,920
lot of it does come down to Daio how

10770
06:45:17,920 --> 06:45:19,440
does he find the angle into the fight

10771
06:45:19,440 --> 06:45:21,240
who does he start on and does he get

10772
06:45:21,240 --> 06:45:22,840
caught in those ultimates cuz this Moran

10773
06:45:22,840 --> 06:45:25,398
is still incredibly susceptible to time

10774
06:45:25,398 --> 06:45:27,440
dilation post man he susceptable to just

10775
06:45:27,440 --> 06:45:30,478
getting Ed without that morph going out

10776
06:45:30,478 --> 06:45:32,120
if that happens so much your DPS goes

10777
06:45:32,120 --> 06:45:34,280
out the window soly that long fight is

10778
06:45:34,280 --> 06:45:36,600
no longer favorable for you it's so wild

10779
06:45:36,600 --> 06:45:39,478
to me how much utoro trusts his team in

10780
06:45:39,478 --> 06:45:41,120
this situation I feel like so many other

10781
06:45:41,120 --> 06:45:43,280
carries especially carries in this

10782
06:45:43,280 --> 06:45:45,040
tournament would have gone for a bkb to

10783
06:45:45,040 --> 06:45:47,200
help protect themselves but he seems to

10784
06:45:47,200 --> 06:45:49,558
just fully trust that Mera is going to

10785
06:45:49,558 --> 06:45:52,000
be able to back him up right I mean you

10786
06:45:52,000 --> 06:45:54,398
you think your Toro God is going to buy

10787
06:45:54,398 --> 06:45:55,320
a

10788
06:45:55,320 --> 06:45:58,360
bkb haven't been watching this man he's

10789
06:45:58,360 --> 06:46:00,160
going to go for Scotty up next which is

10790
06:46:00,160 --> 06:46:03,200
going to make him very tanky gaming

10791
06:46:03,200 --> 06:46:05,718
Gladiators may not let him get to this

10792
06:46:05,718 --> 06:46:08,280
point smoked for very very far forward

10793
06:46:08,280 --> 06:46:10,120
here yeah Radiance turned off for Ace

10794
06:46:10,120 --> 06:46:11,478
they're not showing too much on these

10795
06:46:11,478 --> 06:46:13,600
waves they wanted something so badly out

10796
06:46:13,600 --> 06:46:15,520
of that they used double scans to try

10797
06:46:15,520 --> 06:46:17,878
and find some sort of pickoff but

10798
06:46:17,878 --> 06:46:20,240
they're left with nothing team spirit

10799
06:46:20,240 --> 06:46:22,398
holding around their tier two they saw

10800
06:46:22,398 --> 06:46:24,120
something on that Ward and they'll

10801
06:46:24,120 --> 06:46:25,760
counter smoke it instead they're missing

10802
06:46:25,760 --> 06:46:27,600
the Scotty from yoro Big item versus

10803
06:46:27,600 --> 06:46:29,558
morling but he's happy to fight without

10804
06:46:29,558 --> 06:46:30,638
it

10805
06:46:30,638 --> 06:46:33,360
Tri we'll see nothing

10806
06:46:33,360 --> 06:46:35,080
how closely were you looking at the body

10807
06:46:35,080 --> 06:46:39,040
blocks here and AIS could depend on it

10808
06:46:39,040 --> 06:46:40,280
as they will bypass the vision

10809
06:46:40,280 --> 06:46:42,200
mechanisms level 20 for yoro he has

10810
06:46:42,200 --> 06:46:44,280
Chrono attack speed here plus this full

10811
06:46:44,280 --> 06:46:46,000
meon you get caught in this Chrono it's

10812
06:46:46,000 --> 06:46:49,558
a very different story than the last

10813
06:46:49,558 --> 06:46:51,718
fight how much room are you willing to

10814
06:46:51,718 --> 06:46:53,520
give up right now that charge they spot

10815
06:46:53,520 --> 06:46:56,080
celery chronosphere on the two of them

10816
06:46:56,080 --> 06:46:57,478
so he's going to bring down the support

10817
06:46:57,478 --> 06:46:59,200
first nice use to the dead shot there

10818
06:46:59,200 --> 06:47:00,398
that'll make sure Ace doesn't get

10819
06:47:00,398 --> 06:47:02,600
punished too much but chronosphere for a

10820
06:47:02,600 --> 06:47:04,200
f position I don't think G and

10821
06:47:04,200 --> 06:47:06,360
Gladiators mind that too much as long as

10822
06:47:06,360 --> 06:47:07,760
they don't lose control of the Roshan

10823
06:47:07,760 --> 06:47:09,718
pit during this window the upside is

10824
06:47:09,718 --> 06:47:11,040
that buyback still on cool down for

10825
06:47:11,040 --> 06:47:12,798
celery so they know they're getting the

10826
06:47:12,798 --> 06:47:14,320
4v5 out of that if they take down the

10827
06:47:14,320 --> 06:47:15,440
fury on first there's no way you're

10828
06:47:15,440 --> 06:47:16,920
committing for the r King there Deadshot

10829
06:47:16,920 --> 06:47:18,200
will prevent it

10830
06:47:18,200 --> 06:47:20,600
anyway another quick pick off for yoro

10831
06:47:20,600 --> 06:47:22,080
more gold into his pocket will finish up

10832
06:47:22,080 --> 06:47:22,798
to

10833
06:47:22,798 --> 06:47:25,320
Scotty now what about this next part of

10834
06:47:25,320 --> 06:47:27,040
this match up The Wraith King versus The

10835
06:47:27,040 --> 06:47:28,440
Faceless Void especially this wraith

10836
06:47:28,440 --> 06:47:30,240
King off Lane always going to be going

10837
06:47:30,240 --> 06:47:32,718
the agonum scepter at some point in time

10838
06:47:32,718 --> 06:47:34,160
that that Agony scepter is pretty

10839
06:47:34,160 --> 06:47:36,638
interesting against the burst that yoro

10840
06:47:36,638 --> 06:47:37,718
wants to be able to employ right he

10841
06:47:37,718 --> 06:47:39,520
wants to quos spere make sure that

10842
06:47:39,520 --> 06:47:41,520
there's one hero or maybe two that gets

10843
06:47:41,520 --> 06:47:43,320
no impact from the fight just like it

10844
06:47:43,320 --> 06:47:46,000
looks like Quinn oh he barely gets off

10845
06:47:46,000 --> 06:47:47,398
that but he is going to be slowed down

10846
06:47:47,398 --> 06:47:49,760
as soon as the dkb is worn away the time

10847
06:47:49,760 --> 06:47:51,798
dation kicks in a play and yeah team

10848
06:47:51,798 --> 06:47:53,958
spirit have caught him just good Vision

10849
06:47:53,958 --> 06:47:56,320
on the map let set up for this kill and

10850
06:47:56,320 --> 06:47:57,520
just to he was pushing towards that

10851
06:47:57,520 --> 06:47:58,558
Agony SE there you're talking about the

10852
06:47:58,558 --> 06:48:00,558
ra King eyes the Primal a will also play

10853
06:48:00,558 --> 06:48:02,440
a big part in these fights just breaking

10854
06:48:02,440 --> 06:48:04,478
these down removing some of the passes

10855
06:48:04,478 --> 06:48:05,840
letting them get easy kills on things

10856
06:48:05,840 --> 06:48:07,520
like the enchantress removing some of

10857
06:48:07,520 --> 06:48:10,240
the time off from the faces void any

10858
06:48:10,240 --> 06:48:11,718
extra bit you can gain an advantage for

10859
06:48:11,718 --> 06:48:13,240
Dao in these man fights is going to be

10860
06:48:13,240 --> 06:48:15,798
nice but I mean the ra King a is great

10861
06:48:15,798 --> 06:48:17,080
versus the SS it's just a question of

10862
06:48:17,080 --> 06:48:18,160
can you do anything with like the 5

10863
06:48:18,160 --> 06:48:19,558
Seconds you have afterwards right d

10864
06:48:19,558 --> 06:48:20,878
going to man up they're going to jump

10865
06:48:20,878 --> 06:48:22,360
onto this face vo team they can burst

10866
06:48:22,360 --> 06:48:23,760
him down once again there's that ink

10867
06:48:23,760 --> 06:48:26,240
swell heart dis spell time and attempts

10868
06:48:26,240 --> 06:48:28,080
collaps turn around get that RP on the

10869
06:48:28,080 --> 06:48:29,680
two of them locking down to Roi un

10870
06:48:29,680 --> 06:48:31,040
finishing off and now Ace going to come

10871
06:48:31,040 --> 06:48:33,240
back into this with not much the port

10872
06:48:33,240 --> 06:48:34,958
with no Quinn they knew they had the

10873
06:48:34,958 --> 06:48:36,558
numbers advantage and they take the bite

10874
06:48:36,558 --> 06:48:38,160
in the gameing Gladiators no matter the

10875
06:48:38,160 --> 06:48:40,680
cost he gets a jump away for stab helps

10876
06:48:40,680 --> 06:48:42,360
him out but it's not far enough there is

10877
06:48:42,360 --> 06:48:44,440
nowhere you can go the collaps and utoro

10878
06:48:44,440 --> 06:48:47,398
cannot follow that is a very bold move

10879
06:48:47,398 --> 06:48:49,160
when your Primal is dead he so much of

10880
06:48:49,160 --> 06:48:50,760
your damage so much of your burst damage

10881
06:48:50,760 --> 06:48:52,120
I mean again they're very close to

10882
06:48:52,120 --> 06:48:54,840
bursting yoro but the man knows his

10883
06:48:54,840 --> 06:48:59,080
limits Elvin T help tofu yeah a shot

10884
06:48:59,080 --> 06:49:01,718
from downtown claims the life of

10885
06:49:01,718 --> 06:49:04,320
utoro just as I cter curs the hell out

10886
06:49:04,320 --> 06:49:06,398
of him he gets shot

10887
06:49:06,398 --> 06:49:09,120
down well the man knows his limits but I

10888
06:49:09,120 --> 06:49:10,478
guess not every limit in Dota the

10889
06:49:10,478 --> 06:49:11,840
Tormentor are new will cut him some

10890
06:49:11,840 --> 06:49:15,080
slack but what a f from tofu just claims

10891
06:49:15,080 --> 06:49:18,000
it all there and now the Tormentor did

10892
06:49:18,000 --> 06:49:20,120
go to radiant so they get the kill on

10893
06:49:20,120 --> 06:49:22,240
yoro collapse gets The Shard that's a

10894
06:49:22,240 --> 06:49:25,120
1500 gold kill yeah that's a that's the

10895
06:49:25,120 --> 06:49:27,280
final Shard by the way team s to 36

10896
06:49:27,280 --> 06:49:29,958
minutes in have all the shards for their

10897
06:49:29,958 --> 06:49:31,600
team because they've claimed every

10898
06:49:31,600 --> 06:49:33,600
single Tormentor this is

10899
06:49:33,600 --> 06:49:36,638
crazy of course the Chrono was off cool

10900
06:49:36,638 --> 06:49:37,558
down so you're going to have some

10901
06:49:37,558 --> 06:49:39,320
downtime for your Toro where he would

10902
06:49:39,320 --> 06:49:40,558
have liked to have been up on the map

10903
06:49:40,558 --> 06:49:43,320
and used it surprised it burst

10904
06:49:43,320 --> 06:49:45,600
him he must have like time lock hit the

10905
06:49:45,600 --> 06:49:47,120
torment there I mean At Last At least he

10906
06:49:47,120 --> 06:49:48,398
can lap it off here cuz there's nothing

10907
06:49:48,398 --> 06:49:50,080
else you can

10908
06:49:50,080 --> 06:49:53,320
do back game though they still don't

10909
06:49:53,320 --> 06:49:55,840
have Ace they're still looking forward

10910
06:49:55,840 --> 06:49:58,360
with this smoke there's

10911
06:49:58,360 --> 06:50:01,160
thereo yeah this is I'm surprised gaming

10912
06:50:01,160 --> 06:50:03,000
Gladiators they're surprised that even

10913
06:50:03,000 --> 06:50:03,878
out

10914
06:50:03,878 --> 06:50:06,160
here up on The High

10915
06:50:06,160 --> 06:50:10,040
Ground he doesn't have a TP why are you

10916
06:50:10,040 --> 06:50:11,840
Quinn he's going to be able to get a

10917
06:50:11,840 --> 06:50:13,440
fource stab down to low ground but that

10918
06:50:13,440 --> 06:50:14,718
was an opportunity to get the pick off

10919
06:50:14,718 --> 06:50:16,638
and instead it's collapse who finds the

10920
06:50:16,638 --> 06:50:18,160
pickoff another ogre seal totem for

10921
06:50:18,160 --> 06:50:20,000
celer trying to keep him alive bump back

10922
06:50:20,000 --> 06:50:23,080
in oh the swashbuckle just outside of

10923
06:50:23,080 --> 06:50:25,000
the range there and they

10924
06:50:25,000 --> 06:50:28,320
do back into it D will be the first one

10925
06:50:28,320 --> 06:50:31,000
down Quinn he has bkb can he get it off

10926
06:50:31,000 --> 06:50:33,240

06:50:40,600 --> 06:50:43,200
to clean it up and Ace trying to get

10931
06:50:43,200 --> 06:50:45,798
away desperately blink is up he will get

10932
06:50:45,798 --> 06:50:48,120
out yes oh they got a scan on him yeah

10933
06:50:48,120 --> 06:50:49,958
turn that Radiance off son you need to

10934
06:50:49,958 --> 06:50:51,040
get the hell out of there you got to

10935
06:50:51,040 --> 06:50:52,240
hide you got to hide you can't be

10936
06:50:52,240 --> 06:50:54,478
farming right now there's that Shard

10937
06:50:54,478 --> 06:50:56,280
collaps pulls him back in a little bit

10938
06:50:56,280 --> 06:50:58,360
no Harpoon just yet though so he

10939
06:50:58,360 --> 06:51:00,080
couldn't get him any further yoro knows

10940
06:51:00,080 --> 06:51:01,398
what he wants right now and that is an

10941
06:51:01,398 --> 06:51:03,478
Aegis that is a RH fight that gam could

10942
06:51:03,478 --> 06:51:05,320
have just committed to it's also a fight

10943
06:51:05,320 --> 06:51:08,520
that 30 seconds of it had no yoro they

10944
06:51:08,520 --> 06:51:10,040
couldn't find anything they found an

10945
06:51:10,040 --> 06:51:12,080
inch off of double die between the

10946
06:51:12,080 --> 06:51:13,878
morling and the Primal beast and that's

10947
06:51:13,878 --> 06:51:15,760
it team spirit just way too good at

10948
06:51:15,760 --> 06:51:17,360
kiing these fights out not giving you an

10949
06:51:17,360 --> 06:51:20,000
opening that hame Pike did some serious

10950
06:51:20,000 --> 06:51:22,718
work sent Quinn back to na with his pal

10951
06:51:22,718 --> 06:51:25,080
RZ stuck up there but what else you

10952
06:51:25,080 --> 06:51:26,320
supposed to do you have to find the

10953
06:51:26,320 --> 06:51:28,240
openings you have to dive you only had

10954
06:51:28,240 --> 06:51:29,600
20 seconds without

10955
06:51:29,600 --> 06:51:31,680
yoro just none of it went your way and

10956
06:51:31,680 --> 06:51:33,120
now it's going to be AIS into his pocket

10957
06:51:33,120 --> 06:51:35,958
a cheese on the back and I guess

10958
06:51:35,958 --> 06:51:37,680
everybody can buy bkb at some point

10959
06:51:37,680 --> 06:51:40,120
it'll be his next item here at last to

10960
06:51:40,120 --> 06:51:42,600
seal the

10961
06:51:43,398 --> 06:51:45,680
deal he really wanted to save that

10962
06:51:45,680 --> 06:51:48,558
double damage rune for Laurel or for

10963
06:51:48,558 --> 06:51:52,360
yoro but uh little Triant will deny them

10964
06:51:52,360 --> 06:51:54,600
that opportunity still though team

10965
06:51:54,600 --> 06:51:56,360
spirit got to feel very good about this

10966
06:51:56,360 --> 06:51:58,440
next four minutes they've been winning a

10967
06:51:58,440 --> 06:51:59,920
lot of Team fights lately with that

10968
06:51:59,920 --> 06:52:01,600
extra life on your Toro he's already

10969
06:52:01,600 --> 06:52:04,120
been very aggressive leading a lot of

10970
06:52:04,120 --> 06:52:06,160
the charges for team spirit giving

10971
06:52:06,160 --> 06:52:09,040
information to collapse to follow it up

10972
06:52:09,040 --> 06:52:10,760
the second life I feel like there is

10973
06:52:10,760 --> 06:52:12,798
nothing to stop this man no if you get

10974
06:52:12,798 --> 06:52:14,200
caught in the Chrono you're gone yeah

10975
06:52:14,200 --> 06:52:15,878
that's it even if you're morphing I mean

10976
06:52:15,878 --> 06:52:17,080
who cares right the second you come out

10977
06:52:17,080 --> 06:52:19,478
of it you're basically dead this aags

10978
06:52:19,478 --> 06:52:20,840
from celery can only do so much and

10979
06:52:20,840 --> 06:52:22,000
suddenly the lanes are not getting

10980
06:52:22,000 --> 06:52:23,520
pushed in as deep as they once were

10981
06:52:23,520 --> 06:52:25,080
because this ow is just going to work on

10982
06:52:25,080 --> 06:52:26,878
these cores they're just mopping it up

10983
06:52:26,878 --> 06:52:28,320
at this point the skeletons and the TR

10984
06:52:28,320 --> 06:52:31,240
are just extra gold into their pocket

10985
06:52:31,240 --> 06:52:34,398
we're looking at 4 40 CS for yoro right

10986
06:52:34,398 --> 06:52:37,600
now just cleaning up these Lanes 500 for

10987
06:52:37,600 --> 06:52:39,160
Laurel by the way who has been swashed

10988
06:52:39,160 --> 06:52:41,718
by it feels like the entire map still

10989
06:52:41,718 --> 06:52:42,878
been a tremendous game here on the

10990
06:52:42,878 --> 06:52:45,840
pangle year he is and look at the

10991
06:52:45,840 --> 06:52:47,360
difference in the last hit Manan I mean

10992
06:52:47,360 --> 06:52:48,638
that is what Empower does that's what an

10993
06:52:48,638 --> 06:52:50,080
early mask of Manis into the the

10994
06:52:50,080 --> 06:52:51,920
melstrom does but it's also all these

10995
06:52:51,920 --> 06:52:53,760
summons going down the lanes so it's

10996
06:52:53,760 --> 06:52:56,920
inflated a bit but that's extra gold and

10997
06:52:56,920 --> 06:52:59,798
now Meo with an a this is a great dark

10998
06:52:59,798 --> 06:53:01,520
forra game right and these Soul lines

10999
06:53:01,520 --> 06:53:03,080
have been Landing there's not a lot to

11000
06:53:03,080 --> 06:53:04,680
block them you get the ri King you get

11001
06:53:04,680 --> 06:53:06,080
that Ora going back it's a great

11002
06:53:06,080 --> 06:53:07,600
illusion you get the morphling you're

11003
06:53:07,600 --> 06:53:09,160
going to clear house on the backline so

11004
06:53:09,160 --> 06:53:10,958
suddenly the scale from team spirit

11005
06:53:10,958 --> 06:53:12,080
starting to pick up the pace on their

11006
06:53:12,080 --> 06:53:15,120
supports and these are scary ones RP

11007
06:53:15,120 --> 06:53:17,320
straight up in the Top Lane he got

11008
06:53:17,320 --> 06:53:20,160
caught trying to hit that tier two you

11009
06:53:20,160 --> 06:53:22,320
can get nothing for free against team

11010
06:53:22,320 --> 06:53:24,840
spirit collaps and ni Daio that

11011
06:53:24,840 --> 06:53:27,478
opportunity Daio compliments on the

11012
06:53:27,478 --> 06:53:30,478
initiation but the damage is done gaming

11013
06:53:30,478 --> 06:53:32,600
Gladiators without their carry for for

11014
06:53:32,600 --> 06:53:34,478
70 seconds there's going to be some

11015
06:53:34,478 --> 06:53:36,160
serious damage coming their way that

11016
06:53:36,160 --> 06:53:38,080
just feels like a move that's it's based

11017
06:53:38,080 --> 06:53:39,280
on pressure right they feel like this

11018
06:53:39,280 --> 06:53:40,440
game is slipping away from they feel

11019
06:53:40,440 --> 06:53:41,680
like the scale is going to be instrum

11020
06:53:41,680 --> 06:53:43,920
animal Daio trying to make something

11021
06:53:43,920 --> 06:53:46,040
happen on the map and find a tier two

11022
06:53:46,040 --> 06:53:47,638
instead he will pay the price only for

11023
06:53:47,638 --> 06:53:49,240
an RP in exchange which is going to be

11024
06:53:49,240 --> 06:53:52,040
up pretty much when he's back up how

11025
06:53:52,040 --> 06:53:53,398
much do you want to push with this AIS

11026
06:53:53,398 --> 06:53:56,718
right now level 25 on the Faceless Void

11027
06:53:56,718 --> 06:54:00,000
already he already has the backtrack P

11028
06:54:00,000 --> 06:54:02,080
just going to make that bur even harder

11029
06:54:02,080 --> 06:54:04,000
and says this is enough farming I want

11030
06:54:04,000 --> 06:54:06,840
to end this game I want to end it now

11031
06:54:06,840 --> 06:54:08,558
how much do you have to take the fight

11032
06:54:08,558 --> 06:54:10,920
on your High Ground look at them they're

11033
06:54:10,920 --> 06:54:13,360
just trying to catch whatever they can

11034
06:54:13,360 --> 06:54:16,360
in the side lanes because well you don't

11035
06:54:16,360 --> 06:54:18,280
have a carry so there's not much point

11036
06:54:18,280 --> 06:54:20,520
in acting like you're going to defend

11037
06:54:20,520 --> 06:54:22,958
this mid lane just have to use Ace's

11038
06:54:22,958 --> 06:54:24,200
strength you have to find a way to use

11039
06:54:24,200 --> 06:54:26,398
this ra King a and the radiance burn get

11040
06:54:26,398 --> 06:54:27,840
something going in the fight over the

11041
06:54:27,840 --> 06:54:28,958
long

11042
06:54:28,958 --> 06:54:31,398
duration that is where the painer shines

11043
06:54:31,398 --> 06:54:33,160
and I mean Laurel has had to jump in

11044
06:54:33,160 --> 06:54:34,280
aggressively yet he's just playing

11045
06:54:34,280 --> 06:54:36,360
behind his other cores yeah be a free

11046
06:54:36,360 --> 06:54:38,240
Lane of racks here they're going to go

11047
06:54:38,240 --> 06:54:40,520
for number two Daio 3 seconds on the

11048
06:54:40,520 --> 06:54:43,320
spawn butterfly completed for yoro now

11049
06:54:43,320 --> 06:54:44,798
no mkb in sight you're going to have to

11050
06:54:44,798 --> 06:54:47,440
do this the hard way just charge in and

11051
06:54:47,440 --> 06:54:49,558
hope it goes your direction checking it

11052
06:54:49,558 --> 06:54:52,920
out seeing who's tping in Toro with the

11053
06:54:52,920 --> 06:54:55,240
Lincoln he's got an extra life he's got

11054
06:54:55,240 --> 06:54:57,478
a bkb in his back pack for that second

11055
06:54:57,478 --> 06:54:59,638
life and they got an opportunity from

11056
06:54:59,638 --> 06:55:03,240
collapse P celery out of position roio

11057
06:55:03,240 --> 06:55:04,760
going to try and use that Faceless Void

11058
06:55:04,760 --> 06:55:06,080
for to be able to help out but the

11059
06:55:06,080 --> 06:55:08,160
chronosphere goes work the old not

11060
06:55:08,160 --> 06:55:09,958
actually grabbing the real but still up

11061
06:55:09,958 --> 06:55:11,798
and he finishes off the morlix so easily

11062
06:55:11,798 --> 06:55:14,398
now the RP get the other two cores team

11063
06:55:14,398 --> 06:55:17,798
spirit so clean the extra goats come out

11064
06:55:17,798 --> 06:55:20,478
from the race King but doesn't really do

11065
06:55:20,478 --> 06:55:22,718
anything Ace just pops bkb on the second

11066
06:55:22,718 --> 06:55:24,320
life they do manage to get another pick

11067
06:55:24,320 --> 06:55:25,878
here on his celeries he tries to jump

11068
06:55:25,878 --> 06:55:27,478
forward they've got nothing left in the

11069
06:55:27,478 --> 06:55:30,120
tank on gaming Gladiators they are all

11070
06:55:30,120 --> 06:55:31,120
going to fall they're going to throw

11071
06:55:31,120 --> 06:55:32,638
their damage around the getting

11072
06:55:32,638 --> 06:55:34,398
popped as collapse got a little bit low

11073
06:55:34,398 --> 06:55:36,398
but in the fountain Marl

11074
06:55:36,398 --> 06:55:40,638
goes t a rampage maybe a double no

11075
06:55:40,638 --> 06:55:41,920
tofu's going to deny him that they're

11076
06:55:41,920 --> 06:55:45,360
going to call the GG andless pulled back

11077
06:55:45,360 --> 06:55:48,920
in a this one is a second Rampage to

11078
06:55:48,920 --> 06:55:51,440
finally close it off I mean why not add

11079
06:55:51,440 --> 06:55:53,160
to his total right this is the player

11080
06:55:53,160 --> 06:55:54,958
with the most Rampages in a single TI

11081
06:55:54,958 --> 06:55:57,160
run in history and he will add some more

11082
06:55:57,160 --> 06:56:00,320
to the stat page here as yoro just mops

11083
06:56:00,320 --> 06:56:02,320
them up at the end with way too much Dam

11084
06:56:02,320 --> 06:56:04,478
damage and once more G are sitting here

11085
06:56:04,478 --> 06:56:06,040
thinking what the hell are we supposed

11086
06:56:06,040 --> 06:56:07,920
to do against this team we can't outpace

11087
06:56:07,920 --> 06:56:10,240
him we can't push him we can't outscale

11088
06:56:10,240 --> 06:56:11,878
him we're having troubles in the team

11089
06:56:11,878 --> 06:56:14,240
fights we're losing the towers first

11090
06:56:14,240 --> 06:56:15,920
this man's playing Faceless Void in a

11091
06:56:15,920 --> 06:56:19,080
meta where no one else was really

11092
06:56:19,080 --> 06:56:21,200
willing he got you on the Weaver he got

11093
06:56:21,200 --> 06:56:23,440
you on the Faceless Void team spirit got

11094
06:56:23,440 --> 06:56:25,718
you on the Peno on both sides they

11095
06:56:25,718 --> 06:56:28,000
defeated the Panko and Laurel took it

11096
06:56:28,000 --> 06:56:29,718
into his own hands I mean there was so

11097
06:56:29,718 --> 06:56:31,638
much in that early game where Laurel he

11098
06:56:31,638 --> 06:56:33,798
was controlling so much of the tempo and

11099
06:56:33,798 --> 06:56:36,080
he knows it too and the crowd knows it

11100
06:56:36,080 --> 06:56:37,840
too they're going to thank team spirit

11101
06:56:37,840 --> 06:56:39,440
for an excellent performance in this

11102
06:56:39,440 --> 06:56:41,760
game too but it might be a fast close

11103
06:56:41,760 --> 06:56:43,520
out to the night the way team spirit

11104
06:56:43,520 --> 06:56:45,478
looks utterly Unstoppable they are speed

11105
06:56:45,478 --> 06:56:47,080
running this Grand Final right now and

11106
06:56:47,080 --> 06:56:49,558
the scary part is at 30 minutes gon had

11107
06:56:49,558 --> 06:56:52,080
a lead in that game that game was not

11108
06:56:52,080 --> 06:56:54,080
some super one-sided netw wor stomp even

11109
06:56:54,080 --> 06:56:56,200
with a Magnus void farming it up it's

11110
06:56:56,200 --> 06:56:58,000
just it felt inevitable right like how

11111
06:56:58,000 --> 06:56:59,638
are you taking these late game fights

11112
06:56:59,638 --> 06:57:01,520
even with a ra King a you're respawning

11113
06:57:01,520 --> 06:57:03,280
just to watch the corpses of your

11114
06:57:03,280 --> 06:57:05,638
teammates fall right where you were

11115
06:57:05,638 --> 06:57:07,600
there's no real burst there's no real

11116
06:57:07,600 --> 06:57:09,760
push Tempo here yeah nothing going their

11117
06:57:09,760 --> 06:57:12,080
way in that game too well I mean they at

11118
06:57:12,080 --> 06:57:13,440
least were able to even out the net

11119
06:57:13,440 --> 06:57:14,680
worth a little bit there have to be

11120
06:57:14,680 --> 06:57:15,840
small things that went the way of

11121
06:57:15,840 --> 06:57:17,280
gameing Gladiators are there any

11122
06:57:17,280 --> 06:57:18,558
highlights you can point to I mean I

11123
06:57:18,558 --> 06:57:19,840
think the laning phase was a bit better

11124
06:57:19,840 --> 06:57:22,040
for them but the point in their laning

11125
06:57:22,040 --> 06:57:23,320
phase that they wanted to work the most

11126
06:57:23,320 --> 06:57:24,718
that I feel has worked for them all year

11127
06:57:24,718 --> 06:57:27,040
has been Quinn on Mid and that lane was

11128
06:57:27,040 --> 06:57:28,478
the one that felt a little lackluster to

11129
06:57:28,478 --> 06:57:29,638
me right the Primal Beast had a very

11130
06:57:29,638 --> 06:57:30,840
slow start he didn't get to use the

11131
06:57:30,840 --> 06:57:32,798
power runes it all to come together if

11132
06:57:32,798 --> 06:57:33,798
you're going to beat this team spirit

11133
06:57:33,798 --> 06:57:37,040
team in a grand final at TI you need to

11134
06:57:37,040 --> 06:57:38,600
pull out all of your tricks get all the

11135
06:57:38,600 --> 06:57:41,000
cylinders firing and make it synergized

11136
06:57:41,000 --> 06:57:43,160
at its peak he they have played so many

11137
06:57:43,160 --> 06:57:44,398
games having to go through the lower

11138
06:57:44,398 --> 06:57:47,160
bracket the entire time does gaming

11139
06:57:47,160 --> 06:57:49,280
Gladiators have anything left in the

11140
06:57:49,280 --> 06:57:51,840
tank B back to the panel thank you very

11141
06:57:51,840 --> 06:57:54,200
much Captain SVG we'll find that answer

11142
06:57:54,200 --> 06:57:57,398
in game number three because right now

11143
06:57:57,398 --> 06:58:00,520
team spirit is on Match Point one more

11144
06:58:00,520 --> 06:58:05,440
game away from being crowned second time

11145
06:58:05,440 --> 06:58:07,920
TI champion and what a game they did it

11146
06:58:07,920 --> 06:58:10,760
on here it was a very back and forth a

11147
06:58:10,760 --> 06:58:12,240
lot of fights in this one we have a

11148
06:58:12,240 --> 06:58:13,520
little bit of a change on the panel

11149
06:58:13,520 --> 06:58:16,040
storm Stormer welcome joining us as well

11150
06:58:16,040 --> 06:58:18,080
I want to dive right into it what did

11151
06:58:18,080 --> 06:58:20,600
you make of this game thank you sh um

11152
06:58:20,600 --> 06:58:22,200
yeah I mean this game was actually quite

11153
06:58:22,200 --> 06:58:23,558
a treat to watch for a long time I think

11154
06:58:23,558 --> 06:58:24,718
there was some really really cool place

11155
06:58:24,718 --> 06:58:26,718
coming off from both sides I think L

11156
06:58:26,718 --> 06:58:28,600
played exceptionally well on his pangier

11157
06:58:28,600 --> 06:58:29,920
like there was like some situation where

11158
06:58:29,920 --> 06:58:31,520
they went on in three Heroes and he just

11159
06:58:31,520 --> 06:58:33,200
barely got out I think he carried the

11160
06:58:33,200 --> 06:58:35,040
game on his uh the team on his back for

11161
06:58:35,040 --> 06:58:38,000
quite some time until the and caught up

11162
06:58:38,000 --> 06:58:41,240
but um yeah definitely a two to watch

11163
06:58:41,240 --> 06:58:43,200
yeah I mean for La at least in regards

11164
06:58:43,200 --> 06:58:45,000
to net worth I think I saw a tweet from

11165
06:58:45,000 --> 06:58:46,798
KN where it's like it's the fifth

11166
06:58:46,798 --> 06:58:49,120
highest net worth of any Pang on land

11167
06:58:49,120 --> 06:58:50,760
and it's like he had diffusal he had

11168
06:58:50,760 --> 06:58:53,040
link like pre 20 minutes and just it was

11169
06:58:53,040 --> 06:58:54,600
just an incredible start for he was so

11170
06:58:54,600 --> 06:58:56,558
fed yeah so farmed and it is really hard

11171
06:58:56,558 --> 06:58:58,878
to top the Network's leaderboards as a

11172
06:58:58,878 --> 06:59:00,638
pangal right you usually never see that

11173
06:59:00,638 --> 06:59:03,320
happen but it's also due to the Magnus

11174
06:59:03,320 --> 06:59:05,280
that they were able to play around they

11175
06:59:05,280 --> 06:59:07,520
had three melee cores with a Magnus and

11176
06:59:07,520 --> 06:59:09,360
when the game stagnated they were just

11177
06:59:09,360 --> 06:59:11,160
collecting that netw worth lead every

11178
06:59:11,160 --> 06:59:12,878
time that Gman weren't making any moves

11179
06:59:12,878 --> 06:59:14,840
or any plays that benefited team spirit

11180
06:59:14,840 --> 06:59:16,718
entirely so if you're playing this game

11181
06:59:16,718 --> 06:59:18,760
to scale all of a sudden team spirit

11182
06:59:18,760 --> 06:59:20,160
they've got the superior team fight

11183
06:59:20,160 --> 06:59:21,160
right they've got the chronosphere

11184
06:59:21,160 --> 06:59:22,280
they've got the Rolling Thunder they've

11185
06:59:22,280 --> 06:59:24,798
got the uh RP so it made it so that

11186
06:59:24,798 --> 06:59:26,558
gaming Gladiators couldn't ever really

11187
06:59:26,558 --> 06:59:28,040
look for those fights later on as the

11188
06:59:28,040 --> 06:59:30,200
netw worth lead was built up yeah it

11189
06:59:30,200 --> 06:59:32,080
felt like at some point both teams

11190
06:59:32,080 --> 06:59:34,360
wanted to look for the fights both teams

11191
06:59:34,360 --> 06:59:36,080
were ready to fight but you only want to

11192
06:59:36,080 --> 06:59:37,840
really fight when you know you have the

11193
06:59:37,840 --> 06:59:42,360
advantage and I think T that led to some

11194
06:59:42,360 --> 06:59:45,680
pretty quite quite cool but that's some

11195
06:59:45,680 --> 06:59:47,398
pretty uh pretty surprising locations

11196
06:59:47,398 --> 06:59:48,600
where fights were actually happening

11197
06:59:48,600 --> 06:59:50,520
because we had both teams trying to

11198
06:59:50,520 --> 06:59:52,360
surprise the enemy team in Final

11199
06:59:52,360 --> 06:59:54,360
locations yeah it happened a lot you had

11200
06:59:54,360 --> 06:59:56,280
for in the bot side of the map you had

11201
06:59:56,280 --> 06:59:57,958
like this awkward rosam where Spirit

11202
06:59:57,958 --> 06:59:59,080
started it but they weren't strong

11203
06:59:59,080 --> 07:00:00,360
enough and then they baited out with the

11204
07:00:00,360 --> 07:00:02,240
fight and then we had a Pick Off on to

11205
07:00:02,240 --> 07:00:04,240
Primal and then it's near tormenta where

11206
07:00:04,240 --> 07:00:05,840
theosu is just free farming Top Lane

11207
07:00:05,840 --> 07:00:07,360
hitting a tower and then the rest of

11208
07:00:07,360 --> 07:00:09,240
spirits just slaughtering the entirety

11209
07:00:09,240 --> 07:00:11,040
of gaming Gladiator so I feel like this

11210
07:00:11,040 --> 07:00:12,958
entire game was gaming trying to

11211
07:00:12,958 --> 07:00:14,360
construct a fight where they could

11212
07:00:14,360 --> 07:00:16,320
survive the big spells while Spirit was

11213
07:00:16,320 --> 07:00:18,240
always chasing oh look we have our

11214
07:00:18,240 --> 07:00:19,638
spells available let's just win every

11215
07:00:19,638 --> 07:00:20,958
single fight cuz we know if we have the

11216
07:00:20,958 --> 07:00:22,558
Crono if we have the RP we're going to

11217
07:00:22,558 --> 07:00:24,120
hit these big spells and just Crush

11218
07:00:24,120 --> 07:00:25,760
every single engagement yeah and it's

11219
07:00:25,760 --> 07:00:27,398
hard because they didn't really have

11220
07:00:27,398 --> 07:00:29,200
that overwhelming team fight ability on

11221
07:00:29,200 --> 07:00:30,600
ging because even when they did have

11222
07:00:30,600 --> 07:00:32,680
that Aegis on morphling they couldn't

11223
07:00:32,680 --> 07:00:34,798
really ever make anything happen the

11224
07:00:34,798 --> 07:00:36,200
fight that they did finally manage to

11225
07:00:36,200 --> 07:00:37,920
force versus Spirit when morling had the

11226
07:00:37,920 --> 07:00:39,558
Aegis and they tried to burst The

11227
07:00:39,558 --> 07:00:41,000
Faceless Void they couldn't he time

11228
07:00:41,000 --> 07:00:43,000
walks away he Chronos they end up

11229
07:00:43,000 --> 07:00:44,240
killing the void in the end but they

11230
07:00:44,240 --> 07:00:46,478
didn't really get much in return I mean

11231
07:00:46,478 --> 07:00:48,398
they traded off one of their heroes

11232
07:00:48,398 --> 07:00:49,798
everyone else disengaged and they

11233
07:00:49,798 --> 07:00:51,600
couldn't turn that winning fight when

11234
07:00:51,600 --> 07:00:53,280
they got the void down into anything

11235
07:00:53,280 --> 07:00:55,200
because they committed too much and they

11236
07:00:55,200 --> 07:00:57,080
didn't get enough back and that really

11237
07:00:57,080 --> 07:00:58,520
was the story of the

11238
07:00:58,520 --> 07:01:01,360
game yeah it really really was and I

11239
07:01:01,360 --> 07:01:04,200
feel like we saw team spirit you we okay

11240
07:01:04,200 --> 07:01:05,478
so for people that have been uh

11241
07:01:05,478 --> 07:01:08,040
following their Vlogs they have a lot of

11242
07:01:08,040 --> 07:01:10,718
them they they show a lot of their

11243
07:01:10,718 --> 07:01:13,878
in-game communication uh of their Vlogs

11244
07:01:13,878 --> 07:01:16,680
and those fights that we see them take

11245
07:01:16,680 --> 07:01:21,280
here on the ti stage they seem very calm

11246
07:01:21,280 --> 07:01:24,280
and collected storm stor there's like oh

11247
07:01:24,280 --> 07:01:26,478
I guys I killed that dude yeah I got

11248
07:01:26,478 --> 07:01:28,718
stunned used my ultimate oh you used

11249
07:01:28,718 --> 07:01:30,958
this it's like they you know like you're

11250
07:01:30,958 --> 07:01:33,520
walking in a park like a bird you know

11251
07:01:33,520 --> 07:01:35,798
nice nice tree it's literally very cool

11252
07:01:35,798 --> 07:01:37,280
yeah I mean uh it's it's definitely what

11253
07:01:37,280 --> 07:01:38,600
you want to stay for as well I think

11254
07:01:38,600 --> 07:01:40,240
it's also something that team Tundra was

11255
07:01:40,240 --> 07:01:41,878
exceptionally good as when they won TI

11256
07:01:41,878 --> 07:01:42,878
last year it just shows that you're

11257
07:01:42,878 --> 07:01:44,040
confident what you're saying you're not

11258
07:01:44,040 --> 07:01:46,000
over emotional about things and also but

11259
07:01:46,000 --> 07:01:47,200
I think what I love about this team is

11260
07:01:47,200 --> 07:01:48,760
that even if they die you can see Smiles

11261
07:01:48,760 --> 07:01:50,440
in their face you know like this Yuro

11262
07:01:50,440 --> 07:01:51,680
he's dying at the Tormentor you might

11263
07:01:51,680 --> 07:01:53,520
think like oh I just fed 2K C to tofu

11264
07:01:53,520 --> 07:01:54,840
but then he's just smiling you know and

11265
07:01:54,840 --> 07:01:56,520
all the team like I think they're having

11266
07:01:56,520 --> 07:01:57,840
such a great time right now which makes

11267
07:01:57,840 --> 07:01:59,840
it look even scarier to beat this team I

11268
07:01:59,840 --> 07:02:02,080
think it's worth so much that like no

11269
07:02:02,080 --> 07:02:03,120
what is happening they're keeping it

11270
07:02:03,120 --> 07:02:04,320
calm head and this this calm

11271
07:02:04,320 --> 07:02:05,638
communication that you said like I think

11272
07:02:05,638 --> 07:02:06,920
is really really good to point out

11273
07:02:06,920 --> 07:02:09,280
because it just shows um that they're

11274
07:02:09,280 --> 07:02:11,240
really focus really in zone about the

11275
07:02:11,240 --> 07:02:12,638
most important things you don't overc

11276
07:02:12,638 --> 07:02:14,280
communicate you don't talk louder to

11277
07:02:14,280 --> 07:02:15,558
make sure your voice is being heard

11278
07:02:15,558 --> 07:02:17,520
everybody's on the same level yeah and

11279
07:02:17,520 --> 07:02:19,718
that combine that with the with the fun

11280
07:02:19,718 --> 07:02:21,760
they happening at the same time and that

11281
07:02:21,760 --> 07:02:23,320
is a skill ex I think they have like the

11282
07:02:23,320 --> 07:02:25,120
perfect balance honestly and together

11283
07:02:25,120 --> 07:02:26,798
that with how good they play Da right

11284
07:02:26,798 --> 07:02:28,440
now this team is just really scary is

11285
07:02:28,440 --> 07:02:30,360
really scary I bet the whole team was uh

11286
07:02:30,360 --> 07:02:32,040
was having a lot of fun actually in one

11287
07:02:32,040 --> 07:02:33,478
particular moment and we talked about it

11288
07:02:33,478 --> 07:02:34,840
a couple times already and you've seen

11289
07:02:34,840 --> 07:02:36,878
it in the highlights as well the Great

11290
07:02:36,878 --> 07:02:38,600
Escape from lurl Purge is going to talk

11291
07:02:38,600 --> 07:02:40,718
about it now

11292
07:02:40,718 --> 07:02:43,080
too thank you shiver yeah the Pango

11293
07:02:43,080 --> 07:02:45,080
survive was very very important for

11294
07:02:45,080 --> 07:02:47,320
gaming glad or for uh team spirit

11295
07:02:47,320 --> 07:02:49,718
because he had the most net worth on his

11296
07:02:49,718 --> 07:02:51,398
team if he gets killed it's a big

11297
07:02:51,398 --> 07:02:53,120
comeback momentum potential for gaming

11298
07:02:53,120 --> 07:02:55,240
Gladiators they spotted him farming up

11299
07:02:55,240 --> 07:02:57,040
above they saw his invis run so they

11300
07:02:57,040 --> 07:02:59,160
place the Sentry now and they are

11301
07:02:59,160 --> 07:03:01,000
looking to chain disable him here now

11302
07:03:01,000 --> 07:03:04,080
the uh AOE The Remnant here for for tofu

11303
07:03:04,080 --> 07:03:05,440
it does a little circular thing and

11304
07:03:05,440 --> 07:03:06,920
every ghost that passes through him is

11305
07:03:06,920 --> 07:03:08,240
going to silence him and if they can

11306
07:03:08,240 --> 07:03:10,160
chain disable him it's a really really

11307
07:03:10,160 --> 07:03:12,000
crucial Hill here but unfortunately the

11308
07:03:12,000 --> 07:03:13,520
Primal Beast charge is going to push him

11309
07:03:13,520 --> 07:03:15,478
back outside of the radius of this next

11310
07:03:15,478 --> 07:03:16,798
coming ghost that means the second

11311
07:03:16,798 --> 07:03:19,240
silence doesn't hit the push back does

11312
07:03:19,240 --> 07:03:21,080
but he's disabled still in this very

11313
07:03:21,080 --> 07:03:22,840
moment and he gets pushed slightly to

11314
07:03:22,840 --> 07:03:25,080
the left here by the fear now before

11315
07:03:25,080 --> 07:03:28,840
peno's uh ability here this one the uh

11316
07:03:28,840 --> 07:03:30,320
the the roll thing whatever it's called

11317
07:03:30,320 --> 07:03:32,160
it used to give damage reduction now it

11318
07:03:32,160 --> 07:03:33,718
gives you a barrier so because there was

11319
07:03:33,718 --> 07:03:36,920
three Heroes he gets 600 hp from this

11320
07:03:36,920 --> 07:03:38,760
which buys him time to survive and one

11321
07:03:38,760 --> 07:03:40,680
other moment that was really really cool

11322
07:03:40,680 --> 07:03:42,798
here because he was in trouble and Mir

11323
07:03:42,798 --> 07:03:44,600
was on the right he puts ink swell on

11324
07:03:44,600 --> 07:03:46,240
him it's uh this little animation I know

11325
07:03:46,240 --> 07:03:47,600
there's a lot of stuff going on in this

11326
07:03:47,600 --> 07:03:49,840
clip the ink swell on him he pops this

11327
07:03:49,840 --> 07:03:51,680
the moment before he dies if he doesn't

11328
07:03:51,680 --> 07:03:53,600
do this celery here on the Nature's

11329
07:03:53,600 --> 07:03:55,440
profit attacks him one time a second

11330
07:03:55,440 --> 07:03:56,920
Auto attack would have killed him but

11331
07:03:56,920 --> 07:03:58,478
because these two guys were stunned he

11332
07:03:58,478 --> 07:04:00,320
ends up Surviving all these things going

11333
07:04:00,320 --> 07:04:02,200
together to keep L alive to keep his net

11334
07:04:02,200 --> 07:04:04,520
worth high and waste gaming Gladiators

11335
07:04:04,520 --> 07:04:06,440
time on the map just a incredibly

11336
07:04:06,440 --> 07:04:08,798
important

11337
07:04:09,120 --> 07:04:11,840
moment an incredibly important moment

11338
07:04:11,840 --> 07:04:14,040
for sure and I bet there were a lot of

11339
07:04:14,040 --> 07:04:16,398
people in the crowd cheering I know in

11340
07:04:16,398 --> 07:04:18,080
The Green Room people like oh my God he

11341
07:04:18,080 --> 07:04:19,638
got away from that one and I think a lot

11342
07:04:19,638 --> 07:04:21,760
of people around the world and all the

11343
07:04:21,760 --> 07:04:23,320
different versions that people are

11344
07:04:23,320 --> 07:04:25,080
watching DOTA we have had people

11345
07:04:25,080 --> 07:04:28,040
cheering their M this is from Chicago

11346
07:04:28,040 --> 07:04:29,878
where the Vibes and the atmosphere is

11347
07:04:29,878 --> 07:04:32,240
definitely very high we'll see you get a

11348
07:04:32,240 --> 07:04:35,000
Pon stage I don't know maybe not today

11349
07:04:35,000 --> 07:04:38,440
here but we can only hope it was uh it

11350
07:04:38,440 --> 07:04:40,878
was very dominant towards the end of

11351
07:04:40,878 --> 07:04:43,040
course from team spirit but it was at

11352
07:04:43,040 --> 07:04:45,320
the start of the game incredibly back

11353
07:04:45,320 --> 07:04:46,958
and forth we heard our drafting penals

11354
07:04:46,958 --> 07:04:48,360
say the first seven minutes are going to

11355
07:04:48,360 --> 07:04:50,558
be really important uh that's what the

11356
07:04:50,558 --> 07:04:53,398
coach said as well and gaming Gladiator

11357
07:04:53,398 --> 07:04:56,080
survived that and it looked okay it just

11358
07:04:56,080 --> 07:04:57,920
they couldn't get that final push to get

11359
07:04:57,920 --> 07:05:00,040
the advantage and that is something that

11360
07:05:00,040 --> 07:05:01,878
they're surely going to work on for the

11361
07:05:01,878 --> 07:05:03,638
next game which is coming your way very

11362
07:05:03,638 --> 07:05:08,240
soon this particular point though T it's

11363
07:05:08,240 --> 07:05:09,878
it's it's all or nothing right now

11364
07:05:09,878 --> 07:05:12,280
they're two games down gaming Gladiators

11365
07:05:12,280 --> 07:05:13,798
has been in this situation before but

11366
07:05:13,798 --> 07:05:15,600
that was an online tournament this is

11367
07:05:15,600 --> 07:05:17,878
very different it isn't I'm going just

11368
07:05:17,878 --> 07:05:19,200
say that I don't want to see morling you

11369
07:05:19,200 --> 07:05:22,440
know this hero is artey got eliminated

11370
07:05:22,440 --> 07:05:24,840
with it m Nightfall got eliminated with

11371
07:05:24,840 --> 07:05:27,760
it now Theo wants to play it and he lost

11372
07:05:27,760 --> 07:05:29,878
game too like this here it's the bane of

11373
07:05:29,878 --> 07:05:32,000
these low bracket teams life and

11374
07:05:32,000 --> 07:05:34,080
unfortunately I don't think it's the the

11375
07:05:34,080 --> 07:05:35,320
the one that you want to bring out when

11376
07:05:35,320 --> 07:05:37,200
your life's on the line well you know I

11377
07:05:37,200 --> 07:05:38,558
could only imagine they're going to have

11378
07:05:38,558 --> 07:05:40,440
something something out different plan

11379
07:05:40,440 --> 07:05:42,398
that they have to have and while they're

11380
07:05:42,398 --> 07:05:44,638
planning that we are going to see where

11381
07:05:44,638 --> 07:05:45,958
Casey's hiding I think she's in the

11382
07:05:45,958 --> 07:05:48,080
crowd somewhere where are you Casey I'm

11383

should do when he starts talking louder

11423
07:07:23,958 --> 07:07:25,718
seats in the house right been here for

11424
07:07:25,718 --> 07:07:26,680
three

11425
07:07:26,680 --> 07:07:30,040
days best seats in the House

11426
07:07:30,040 --> 07:07:33,878
nice oh oh I hear a I hear a cheer

11427
07:07:33,878 --> 07:07:37,280
starting three people all

11428
07:07:37,280 --> 07:07:40,160
right thank you very much Casey I mean

11429
07:07:40,160 --> 07:07:42,600
that does look magical I will say that

11430
07:07:42,600 --> 07:07:44,798
is definitely one of the better seats in

11431
07:07:44,798 --> 07:07:46,638
the House although I must say there's a

11432
07:07:46,638 --> 07:07:48,360
lot of good seats the screens are

11433
07:07:48,360 --> 07:07:50,680
fantastic the DOTA has been fantastic

11434
07:07:50,680 --> 07:07:51,718
but I

11435
07:07:51,718 --> 07:07:54,200
would I I'm going to show a little bias

11436
07:07:54,200 --> 07:07:56,320
here I would really like this series to

11437
07:07:56,320 --> 07:07:58,160
not be in three so I'm rooting for

11438
07:07:58,160 --> 07:08:00,240
gaming Gladiators in the next one and I

11439
07:08:00,240 --> 07:08:03,718
I wanted I know one more Dota 2 coming

11440
07:08:03,718 --> 07:08:05,680
into the climate pledge Arena here

11441
07:08:05,680 --> 07:08:08,280
tonight and I want to know for my panel

11442
07:08:08,280 --> 07:08:10,160
storm stor what do gamer Gladiators need

11443
07:08:10,160 --> 07:08:12,718
to do ah I mean I think first of all

11444
07:08:12,718 --> 07:08:14,160
don't let it get to your head I think

11445
07:08:14,160 --> 07:08:15,798
they are respecting T maybe a little bit

11446
07:08:15,798 --> 07:08:17,320
too much as well they're not showing the

11447
07:08:17,320 --> 07:08:18,958
same gaming Gladiator far that they show

11448
07:08:18,958 --> 07:08:20,760
the entire lower bracket run you have to

11449
07:08:20,760 --> 07:08:22,240
remember this team stting lower bracket

11450
07:08:22,240 --> 07:08:23,760
and now beat how many teams six seven

11451
07:08:23,760 --> 07:08:25,600
teams in a row to get here I just think

11452
07:08:25,600 --> 07:08:27,478
they have to get spur out of their head

11453
07:08:27,478 --> 07:08:29,558
and uh just focus on the own daughter

11454
07:08:29,558 --> 07:08:30,878
again maybe adjust the drafting a little

11455
07:08:30,878 --> 07:08:33,080
bit and and then just you know keep the

11456
07:08:33,080 --> 07:08:35,040
ball roll uh rolling again get back to

11457
07:08:35,040 --> 07:08:37,160
your seat get back to your seat I think

11458
07:08:37,160 --> 07:08:39,440
everybody should get back to their seats

11459
07:08:39,440 --> 07:08:41,080
right about now because ladies and

11460
07:08:41,080 --> 07:08:43,760
gentlemen we want some more DOTA to be

11461
07:08:43,760 --> 07:08:46,280
played we have got team spirit two games

11462
07:08:46,280 --> 07:08:51,080

so I want to have no voices left by the

07:09:46,638 --> 07:09:48,360
end of this one I know a lot of people

11477
07:09:48,360 --> 07:09:51,000
have already spent everything they had

11478
07:09:51,000 --> 07:09:53,000
but I know we got to lead a little bit

11479
07:09:53,000 --> 07:09:55,760
more coming out for game number three we

11480
07:09:55,760 --> 07:09:58,160
know they can do what they've been in

11481
07:09:58,160 --> 07:10:01,958
Grand finals so many times and every

11482
07:10:01,958 --> 07:10:05,280
single L event this year in the DPC

11483
07:10:05,280 --> 07:10:07,878
gaming Gladiators has come out on top

11484
07:10:07,878 --> 07:10:10,398
team spirit they started really clicking

11485
07:10:10,398 --> 07:10:12,600
te at riab Masters and they have not

11486
07:10:12,600 --> 07:10:14,520
dropped the ball since and the fact that

11487
07:10:14,520 --> 07:10:16,080
they coming into this Grand finals that

11488
07:10:16,080 --> 07:10:17,638
like each draft is completely different

11489
07:10:17,638 --> 07:10:19,558
in game one Weaver Beast Master they

11490
07:10:19,558 --> 07:10:21,520
swarm them map they the aggressors game

11491
07:10:21,520 --> 07:10:23,760
two they got big cooldowns Magnus void

11492
07:10:23,760 --> 07:10:26,040
like being the team down to O and having

11493
07:10:26,040 --> 07:10:27,760
to try and work out how do we do with

11494
07:10:27,760 --> 07:10:29,520
aggression how do we do with the skan

11495
07:10:29,520 --> 07:10:30,600
like you don't know what's going to come

11496
07:10:30,600 --> 07:10:32,520
at you in this game so for gaming it's

11497
07:10:32,520 --> 07:10:33,840
not about team spirit at this point it's

11498
07:10:33,840 --> 07:10:35,320
about what can they bring themselves

11499
07:10:35,320 --> 07:10:36,440
what is their draft to get them through

11500
07:10:36,440 --> 07:10:38,320
the laning phase and set themselves up a

11501
07:10:38,320 --> 07:10:40,160
game that they can actually dictate cuz

11502
07:10:40,160 --> 07:10:41,600
right now they're just victim to team

11503
07:10:41,600 --> 07:10:43,958
spirit two times in a row yeah but also

11504
07:10:43,958 --> 07:10:46,760
I I just want to have storm uh elaborate

11505
07:10:46,760 --> 07:10:47,760
a little bit more and what he was

11506
07:10:47,760 --> 07:10:49,120
talking about when he said they need to

11507
07:10:49,120 --> 07:10:51,200
get Spirit out of their heads and how do

11508
07:10:51,200 --> 07:10:53,520
you feel like that what what does that

11509
07:10:53,520 --> 07:10:55,120
mean when you say that the enemy team is

11510
07:10:55,120 --> 07:10:56,280
in your head are you drafting

11511
07:10:56,280 --> 07:10:57,840
differently are you playing differently

11512
07:10:57,840 --> 07:10:59,240
can you speak to it from your personal

11513
07:10:59,240 --> 07:11:00,798
experience yes I think both of it I

11514
07:11:00,798 --> 07:11:03,000
think like um I think first of all all

11515
07:11:03,000 --> 07:11:04,360
the gaming players just play the heroes

11516
07:11:04,360 --> 07:11:05,440
that they're most comfortable with that

11517
07:11:05,440 --> 07:11:07,080
they don't like for example draft Heroes

11518
07:11:07,080 --> 07:11:08,160
cuz they want to block pick them from

11519
07:11:08,160 --> 07:11:09,280
the enemy team or something like that

11520
07:11:09,280 --> 07:11:10,798
they should just play their own game in

11521
07:11:10,798 --> 07:11:11,878
regardless of who the who they're

11522
07:11:11,878 --> 07:11:13,120
playing against and I know that some

11523
07:11:13,120 --> 07:11:15,040
players on gaming like it is good to

11524
07:11:15,040 --> 07:11:16,360
have healthy respect towards the enemy

11525
07:11:16,360 --> 07:11:18,080
team on team spirit but I don't think it

11526
07:11:18,080 --> 07:11:19,680
should like affect your own gameplay too

11527
07:11:19,680 --> 07:11:20,840
much you should respect what the enemy

11528
07:11:20,840 --> 07:11:21,878
team is doing you should know their

11529
07:11:21,878 --> 07:11:23,638
strengths and weaknesses but it should

11530
07:11:23,638 --> 07:11:24,680
not cause yourself to have more

11531
07:11:24,680 --> 07:11:26,200
weaknesses if that makes sense just

11532
07:11:26,200 --> 07:11:28,600
basically reset don't care who you play

11533
07:11:28,600 --> 07:11:30,000
play against remember all the games that

11534
07:11:30,000 --> 07:11:31,398
got you to this point got you through

11535
07:11:31,398 --> 07:11:32,958
the entire lower bracket to this game

11536
07:11:32,958 --> 07:11:36,200
three and make it like a home run again

11537
07:11:36,200 --> 07:11:37,760
got to remember as well team spirit when

11538
07:11:37,760 --> 07:11:39,240
they won TI 10 back then right they were

11539
07:11:39,240 --> 07:11:41,200
also two games ahead and then it still

11540
07:11:41,200 --> 07:11:42,718
went to a five game series against PSG

11541
07:11:42,718 --> 07:11:45,440
lgd back then so this is not over yet

11542
07:11:45,440 --> 07:11:47,000
whatsoever and I hope gaming Gladiators

11543
07:11:47,000 --> 07:11:48,360
also have that in their head right now

11544
07:11:48,360 --> 07:11:50,120
that like you know it's maybe a longer

11545
07:11:50,120 --> 07:11:51,440
day for them as well they also have to

11546
07:11:51,440 --> 07:11:54,000
play the lower bracket finals against uh

11547
07:11:54,000 --> 07:11:57,160
I forgot just now I bad bad memory lgd

11548
07:11:57,160 --> 07:12:00,920
lgd okay it's okay with lgd right and

11549
07:12:00,920 --> 07:12:02,958
now they here again so it is a a longer

11550
07:12:02,958 --> 07:12:04,520
day for them but I all just hope they

11551
07:12:04,520 --> 07:12:06,080
like whatever it was they they got the

11552
07:12:06,080 --> 07:12:08,680
energy running again and they just go in

11553
07:12:08,680 --> 07:12:10,680
into R yeah we're going to find now can

11554
07:12:10,680 --> 07:12:12,638
gaming Gladiators Force out a next game

11555
07:12:12,638 --> 07:12:14,680
or will team spirit be the two time

11556
07:12:14,680 --> 07:12:18,638
champion and let's hear it for game

11557
07:12:18,958 --> 07:12:26,200
three team spirit versus game in

11558
07:12:26,200 --> 07:12:28,600
Gladiators Grand

11559
07:12:28,600 --> 07:12:33,240
Finals game three has turn to B welcome

11560
07:12:33,240 --> 07:12:35,040
back to the draft panel for game number

11561
07:12:35,040 --> 07:12:37,398
three everybody this is everything on

11562
07:12:37,398 --> 07:12:39,478
the line for gaming gliders down zero to

11563
07:12:39,478 --> 07:12:41,558
team spirit have been crushing so far

11564
07:12:41,558 --> 07:12:43,200
seems like they have all the answers

11565
07:12:43,200 --> 07:12:44,600
they have all the strategies that they

11566
07:12:44,600 --> 07:12:46,718
need to become Champions once again just

11567
07:12:46,718 --> 07:12:49,760
like back two years ago what do you guys

11568
07:12:49,760 --> 07:12:51,040
want to see gaming gliders I feel like

11569
07:12:51,040 --> 07:12:52,360
I'm repeating myself after game number

11570
07:12:52,360 --> 07:12:54,440
one but it really is the story here how

11571
07:12:54,440 --> 07:12:56,360
can gaming gliders dig themselves out of

11572
07:12:56,360 --> 07:12:57,600
the strategical hold they found

11573
07:12:57,600 --> 07:12:59,080
themselves in honestly I thought their

11574
07:12:59,080 --> 07:13:00,718
draft last game they had a really good

11575
07:13:00,718 --> 07:13:02,718
shot I I think they identified that they

11576
07:13:02,718 --> 07:13:05,320
want to Target a little bit more of non

11577
07:13:05,320 --> 07:13:06,680
collapse Heroes they let collapse guys

11578
07:13:06,680 --> 07:13:08,558
Magnus and I thought that it was not a

11579
07:13:08,558 --> 07:13:10,360
bad idea I don't think collapse had the

11580
07:13:10,360 --> 07:13:12,080
usual Magnus impact maybe he didn't need

11581
07:13:12,080 --> 07:13:14,000
it maybe he didn't get there uh T was

11582
07:13:14,000 --> 07:13:17,398
able to pick up a early uter but I think

11583
07:13:17,398 --> 07:13:19,120
I just want them to do that but there

11584
07:13:19,120 --> 07:13:20,600
was a time where like they had the

11585
07:13:20,600 --> 07:13:21,878
triple wave with Quinn I want them to

11586
07:13:21,878 --> 07:13:23,920
play even more for the mid pressure cuz

11587
07:13:23,920 --> 07:13:25,718
L just see it I don't know the guy's too

11588
07:13:25,718 --> 07:13:27,280
good he had too good a

11589
07:13:27,280 --> 07:13:31,920
game uh I would like uh greaters uh

11590
07:13:31,920 --> 07:13:34,320
get back to the idea of super pressure

11591
07:13:34,320 --> 07:13:37,360
super Tempo crazy super fast uh super

11592
07:13:37,360 --> 07:13:40,840
strong Lanes I think uh but potentially

11593
07:13:40,840 --> 07:13:43,798
might work yeah something like this you

11594
07:13:43,798 --> 07:13:45,558
you need to risk at some point right

11595
07:13:45,558 --> 07:13:46,878
you're

11596
07:13:46,878 --> 07:13:49,398
02 they definitely have it like we

11597
07:13:49,398 --> 07:13:51,478
definitely gave a very good fights in

11598
07:13:51,478 --> 07:13:53,920
both games like both games we actually

11599
07:13:53,920 --> 07:13:55,600
gave good fights we had good lanes and

11600
07:13:55,600 --> 07:13:58,798
stuff yeah but uh this last game was

11601
07:13:58,798 --> 07:14:00,520
rough to play after some point because

11602
07:14:00,520 --> 07:14:02,638
vo Magnus is just too strong like when

11603
07:14:02,638 --> 07:14:04,920
it come to late game so I hope this time

11604
07:14:04,920 --> 07:14:07,478
maybe we just you know go super

11605
07:14:07,478 --> 07:14:10,000
Tempo I definitely agree D on that one

11606
07:14:10,000 --> 07:14:11,798
the way gaming gladers got here was with

11607
07:14:11,798 --> 07:14:14,120
that Tempo pushing The High Ground it

11608
07:14:14,120 --> 07:14:15,360
felt like in that last game they kind of

11609
07:14:15,360 --> 07:14:16,760
fell back like we don't really want to

11610
07:14:16,760 --> 07:14:17,600
do that and instead we're going to try

11611
07:14:17,600 --> 07:14:19,200
and matchu in the late game pick up a

11612
07:14:19,200 --> 07:14:21,280
Daio morling he played pretty amazing

11613
07:14:21,280 --> 07:14:22,558
for the most part had a couple bad

11614
07:14:22,558 --> 07:14:24,320
deaths but overall like you're playing

11615
07:14:24,320 --> 07:14:25,958
into how team spirit wants to play at

11616
07:14:25,958 --> 07:14:27,120
that point you're not really playing the

11617
07:14:27,120 --> 07:14:29,160
game that got you into this Grand finals

11618
07:14:29,160 --> 07:14:31,120
in particular so we'll see if they go

11619
07:14:31,120 --> 07:14:32,520
ahead and do that but the problem is I

11620
07:14:32,520 --> 07:14:33,760
think when you play against team spirit

11621
07:14:33,760 --> 07:14:35,200
right now there's like a triple threat

11622
07:14:35,200 --> 07:14:36,718
here it's like you have to deal with

11623
07:14:36,718 --> 07:14:37,920
collapse which they've been trying to do

11624
07:14:37,920 --> 07:14:39,878
through bands and then I think what

11625
07:14:39,878 --> 07:14:41,558
really leveled up spirit is Laurel he's

11626
07:14:41,558 --> 07:14:43,398
just playing so good every game and you

11627
07:14:43,398 --> 07:14:45,360
see Quinn he's normally taking control

11628
07:14:45,360 --> 07:14:47,360
of the map he's like making moves he

11629
07:14:47,360 --> 07:14:48,638
hasn't been able to in these last two

11630
07:14:48,638 --> 07:14:50,398
games cuz L's having a great laning

11631
07:14:50,398 --> 07:14:52,200
stage and of course there's always yoro

11632
07:14:52,200 --> 07:14:53,760
who's going to pick the CK but you don't

11633
07:14:53,760 --> 07:14:55,840
even know if it's his he's strategically

11634
07:14:55,840 --> 07:14:58,398
taking away a lot of daos Heroes making

11635
07:14:58,398 --> 07:14:59,718
them feel a bit uncomfortable so there's

11636
07:14:59,718 --> 07:15:01,160
a lot of things they're doing Strat

11637
07:15:01,160 --> 07:15:02,798
level and in game that it's just really

11638
07:15:02,798 --> 07:15:04,920
hard for gaming to address so what do

11639
07:15:04,920 --> 07:15:06,878
you think uh gaming if we want to see

11640
07:15:06,878 --> 07:15:08,398
this early aggression from them what is

11641
07:15:08,398 --> 07:15:09,958
the first pick of the game do you just

11642
07:15:09,958 --> 07:15:11,718
go for the celery end chair and you're

11643
07:15:11,718 --> 07:15:14,000
like okay full focus on early laning

11644
07:15:14,000 --> 07:15:15,638
stage and putting that pressure your gen

11645
07:15:15,638 --> 07:15:16,760
was obviously banned that you've had a

11646
07:15:16,760 --> 07:15:19,280
great success within that macro strategy

11647
07:15:19,280 --> 07:15:22,760
is the en into CK even appealing to

11648
07:15:22,760 --> 07:15:25,320
start off I think it's a it's normally

11649
07:15:25,320 --> 07:15:27,000
like a decent match up for CK cuz he's

11650
07:15:27,000 --> 07:15:28,320
actually one of the heroes that can kill

11651
07:15:28,320 --> 07:15:29,398
pretty easily when you bring her

11652
07:15:29,398 --> 07:15:30,600
position but honestly I sort of like

11653
07:15:30,600 --> 07:15:32,440
that line of thought uh I think at this

11654
07:15:32,440 --> 07:15:34,200
tournament they usually pick ench with

11655
07:15:34,200 --> 07:15:36,280
Weaver um just because it gives the an a

11656
07:15:36,280 --> 07:15:37,638
really strong Lane once you give an a

11657
07:15:37,638 --> 07:15:38,638
strong Lane you can Snowball the other

11658
07:15:38,638 --> 07:15:40,080
lane you can leave it alone but I don't

11659
07:15:40,080 --> 07:15:41,280
mind that if they pick another strong

11660
07:15:41,280 --> 07:15:43,160
carry with it okay there's the AA we

11661
07:15:43,160 --> 07:15:45,080
were looking for in both of the previous

11662
07:15:45,080 --> 07:15:46,558
games and this time gam are going to

11663
07:15:46,558 --> 07:15:48,320
bring it out does this fit the bill for

11664
07:15:48,320 --> 07:15:50,200
you guys not a strong laner not a strong

11665
07:15:50,200 --> 07:15:53,280
laner not a fast tempo hero but it can

11666
07:15:53,280 --> 07:15:55,600
buff really well like other Heroes that

11667
07:15:55,600 --> 07:15:57,798
you can have in a draft uh Vortex is

11668
07:15:57,798 --> 07:15:59,958
extremely strong also shut down a lot of

11669
07:15:59,958 --> 07:16:02,240
like fat Heroes with B her ofas and

11670
07:16:02,240 --> 07:16:05,080
stuff so might see something if you

11671
07:16:05,080 --> 07:16:07,478
build up a strong like uh carry that

11672
07:16:07,478 --> 07:16:09,840
fits a on Lane it's can still be pretty

11673
07:16:09,840 --> 07:16:11,600
strong Lane yeah I think the hero he

11674
07:16:11,600 --> 07:16:12,958
just has a lot of range so he keeps

11675
07:16:12,958 --> 07:16:14,320
clicking right if the lane is stable and

11676
07:16:14,320 --> 07:16:15,360
you get to just keep clicking your

11677
07:16:15,360 --> 07:16:16,638
opponent his Lane's like not weak or

11678
07:16:16,638 --> 07:16:17,798
anything he's going to constantly harass

11679
07:16:17,798 --> 07:16:19,840
on the region I think generally what a

11680
07:16:19,840 --> 07:16:21,080
picks mean is that they want to play

11681
07:16:21,080 --> 07:16:22,798
with their mid generally when you pick a

11682
07:16:22,798 --> 07:16:24,240
you pick some high damage mid and they

11683
07:16:24,240 --> 07:16:25,558
just sort of run around together you get

11684
07:16:25,558 --> 07:16:26,680
stacks and then they play together you

11685
07:16:26,680 --> 07:16:28,000
get Stacks you get play together and I

11686
07:16:28,000 --> 07:16:29,558
think that's also something that we saw

11687
07:16:29,558 --> 07:16:30,958
a lot from gladers in this tournament

11688
07:16:30,958 --> 07:16:32,320
they would play a lot off these Stacks I

11689
07:16:32,320 --> 07:16:33,958
think the AA could be a good start for

11690
07:16:33,958 --> 07:16:35,478
that look at that stat this is their

11691
07:16:35,478 --> 07:16:36,680
first time playing the hero this

11692
07:16:36,680 --> 07:16:38,040
tournament they haven't brought out the

11693
07:16:38,040 --> 07:16:40,760
AA a single time so really digging deep

11694
07:16:40,760 --> 07:16:42,840
here in the final game and or I say the

11695
07:16:42,840 --> 07:16:44,360
final game what could be the final game

11696
07:16:44,360 --> 07:16:46,638
for them um to look at it from the other

11697
07:16:46,638 --> 07:16:48,040
perspective team spirit this is probably

11698
07:16:48,040 --> 07:16:49,878
a surprise for them given the

11699
07:16:49,878 --> 07:16:51,120
circumstances that there hasn't been a

11700
07:16:51,120 --> 07:16:53,840
single AA from Gladiators do you change

11701
07:16:53,840 --> 07:16:56,040
any sort of approach on the spirit side

11702
07:16:56,040 --> 07:16:57,280
I guess like you guys said maybe you

11703
07:16:57,280 --> 07:16:59,000
want to keep the CK Flex what are your

11704
07:16:59,000 --> 07:17:00,398
what are your next two go-to picks to

11705
07:17:00,398 --> 07:17:03,040
make this a feel bad laning stage I

11706
07:17:03,040 --> 07:17:04,320
think the last time they ran this

11707
07:17:04,320 --> 07:17:05,520
they're probably looking at a dark

11708
07:17:05,520 --> 07:17:07,280
Willow for Spirit to Lane it that lane

11709
07:17:07,280 --> 07:17:09,760
seemed incredibly strong I'm not sure

11710
07:17:09,760 --> 07:17:11,040
who's going to play the CK they might

11711
07:17:11,040 --> 07:17:13,200
keep it open for a while it is a little

11712
07:17:13,200 --> 07:17:15,360
Annoying to play CK vers a in some ways

11713
07:17:15,360 --> 07:17:17,080
cuz the armlet issue you can't really

11714
07:17:17,080 --> 07:17:18,798
toggle that so that could be annoying

11715
07:17:18,798 --> 07:17:20,920
but then again the fantasm does delete

11716
07:17:20,920 --> 07:17:22,600
AA pretty quickly so I could see this

11717
07:17:22,600 --> 07:17:25,680
being an offlane CK if yoro finds a

11718
07:17:25,680 --> 07:17:27,040
better pick for himself but I think the

11719
07:17:27,040 --> 07:17:28,120
dark Willow is definitely something

11720
07:17:28,120 --> 07:17:30,120
they're looking at I would really like

11721
07:17:30,120 --> 07:17:31,398
if they pick dark will I think what you

11722
07:17:31,398 --> 07:17:32,878
said about the three CK sounds good as

11723
07:17:32,878 --> 07:17:34,920
well because a can keep clicking the CK

11724
07:17:34,920 --> 07:17:36,040
but as soon as he it's level three or

11725
07:17:36,040 --> 07:17:37,120
four these clicks aren't going to do

11726
07:17:37,120 --> 07:17:38,320
anything to him at

11727
07:17:38,320 --> 07:17:41,760
all yeah uh a afraid of mobile heroes

11728
07:17:41,760 --> 07:17:43,398
and heroes who are very fast and can

11729
07:17:43,398 --> 07:17:45,558
jump uh back lines and stuff like this

11730
07:17:45,558 --> 07:17:48,280
so we can see already Primal and P BS

11731
07:17:48,280 --> 07:17:51,000
and uh CK is one of those Heroes

11732
07:17:51,000 --> 07:17:52,920
actually it's pretty like Fast hero it

11733
07:17:52,920 --> 07:17:56,040
gets into back lines pretty fast so uh

11734
07:17:56,040 --> 07:17:58,958
Heroes who doesn't have a in some sense

11735
07:17:58,958 --> 07:18:01,718
maybe TB can work again for spirit

11736
07:18:01,718 --> 07:18:04,320
because uh you always can swap HP like

11737
07:18:04,320 --> 07:18:06,558
even even if you under

11738
07:18:06,558 --> 07:18:08,920
ay yeah I think they're going to pick 18

11739
07:18:08,920 --> 07:18:10,398
Spectre like they should start to look

11740
07:18:10,398 --> 07:18:11,958
at it I don't know if they will for sure

11741
07:18:11,958 --> 07:18:13,280
but I liked what you said about like

11742
07:18:13,280 --> 07:18:15,000
getting these backline jumpers I think

11743
07:18:15,000 --> 07:18:16,958
yoro he played a lot of Spectre I mean

11744
07:18:16,958 --> 07:18:18,040
he played some at this tournament but he

11745
07:18:18,040 --> 07:18:19,600
was playing a lot of Spectre and pubs he

11746
07:18:19,600 --> 07:18:21,320
always goes for some really high damage

11747
07:18:21,320 --> 07:18:24,000
builds you go like bloodthorn uh Manta

11748
07:18:24,000 --> 07:18:25,440
like he never goes for some like tanky

11749
07:18:25,440 --> 07:18:26,958
buat at all he just looks to kill the

11750
07:18:26,958 --> 07:18:29,000
backline I guess grimo does something

11751
07:18:29,000 --> 07:18:30,240
similar that you were saying as well

11752
07:18:30,240 --> 07:18:31,680
right just giving a really high kill

11753
07:18:31,680 --> 07:18:33,120
threat Lane you want to make sure that

11754
07:18:33,120 --> 07:18:35,240
the CK is at least open as a flex for

11755
07:18:35,240 --> 07:18:37,240
the 18 pick yeah I think they go for

11756
07:18:37,240 --> 07:18:38,600
that because it's a lot better ver a

11757
07:18:38,600 --> 07:18:40,040
pangle than the willow would be right

11758
07:18:40,040 --> 07:18:41,680
you can get the leash on him and then he

11759
07:18:41,680 --> 07:18:44,320
can get stuck so same thing in the

11760
07:18:44,320 --> 07:18:45,638
laning stage though it's really strong

11761
07:18:45,638 --> 07:18:47,558
get on top of him lots of damage just

11762
07:18:47,558 --> 07:18:49,398
Grim is better for this particular game

11763
07:18:49,398 --> 07:18:51,280
Trant is in again this was a hero Spirit

11764
07:18:51,280 --> 07:18:53,558
ran against Pango last time uh but they

11765
07:18:53,558 --> 07:18:57,040
are going to go for the Tusk

11766
07:18:57,040 --> 07:18:59,958
tusy are we are we committed here to a

11767
07:18:59,958 --> 07:19:01,760
five Tusk for this reason has mea been

11768
07:19:01,760 --> 07:19:03,520
playing Grim he has right they've both

11769
07:19:03,520 --> 07:19:05,240
played both of these Heroes so this for

11770
07:19:05,240 --> 07:19:07,000
team spirit I believe is a complete Flex

11771
07:19:07,000 --> 07:19:08,718
among their support players uh mea has

11772
07:19:08,718 --> 07:19:12,120
not play Tusk so it's most like 100% in

11773
07:19:12,120 --> 07:19:13,920
poska so far did he not play Tusk in

11774
07:19:13,920 --> 07:19:16,958
game one am I oh he played it in the

11775
07:19:16,958 --> 07:19:18,840
last game but outside of that I outside

11776
07:19:18,840 --> 07:19:20,160
of this series okay got it yeah my notes

11777
07:19:20,160 --> 07:19:21,398
are outdated from the last I'm sure they

11778
07:19:21,398 --> 07:19:25,600
can Flex it perfectly well um I think

11779
07:19:25,600 --> 07:19:27,120
actually a Mor is not banned in this

11780
07:19:27,120 --> 07:19:29,080
series which is sort of surprising cuz I

11781
07:19:29,080 --> 07:19:30,840
mean they broke gam confidence and the

11782
07:19:30,840 --> 07:19:32,760
hero a bit because I think I don't know

11783
07:19:32,760 --> 07:19:34,440
I think tofu played literally every game

11784
07:19:34,440 --> 07:19:36,200
on this hero before

11785
07:19:36,200 --> 07:19:38,798
that you just go back for it yeah

11786
07:19:38,798 --> 07:19:42,200
because it does what need him to do

11787
07:19:42,200 --> 07:19:44,558
right I feel like you just have so many

11788
07:19:44,558 --> 07:19:47,680
issues with gon's other Heroes that you

11789
07:19:47,680 --> 07:19:49,000
feel like you don't have to ban it cuz

11790
07:19:49,000 --> 07:19:50,520
you have to ban so many other things in

11791
07:19:50,520 --> 07:19:52,440
this game like the necro the Phoenix the

11792
07:19:52,440 --> 07:19:54,680
chin all these heals and this is really

11793
07:19:54,680 --> 07:19:56,320
good Banning I think by team spirit even

11794
07:19:56,320 --> 07:19:58,160
the conka these lineups where you see

11795
07:19:58,160 --> 07:20:00,398
them group up be able to push they're

11796
07:20:00,398 --> 07:20:02,200
not being able to get them because you

11797
07:20:02,200 --> 07:20:03,478
have to deal with the Heroes that you

11798
07:20:03,478 --> 07:20:04,958
see in front of you and some of your

11799
07:20:04,958 --> 07:20:06,680
best heroes to do these pushes are just

11800
07:20:06,680 --> 07:20:08,280
being banned out by team spirit so

11801
07:20:08,280 --> 07:20:09,840
they're going to play the brew master

11802
07:20:09,840 --> 07:20:12,000
the only question I do have yet again is

11803
07:20:12,000 --> 07:20:14,080
is this Pango too early is it too early

11804
07:20:14,080 --> 07:20:15,680
of a Pango game will we have a game

11805
07:20:15,680 --> 07:20:16,878
right now it looks like they only have

11806
07:20:16,878 --> 07:20:19,160
one answer for him but I expect more to

11807
07:20:19,160 --> 07:20:20,680
come is there any mid laners potentially

11808
07:20:20,680 --> 07:20:22,520
dendy that can punish that left in the

11809
07:20:22,520 --> 07:20:25,320
pool uh for sure for sure there's a

11810
07:20:25,320 --> 07:20:28,360
bunch like this this hero become not as

11811
07:20:28,360 --> 07:20:29,760
strong as it used to be it's actually

11812
07:20:29,760 --> 07:20:31,280
pretty strong Lane Ste

11813
07:20:31,280 --> 07:20:34,240
like here we go the lane Punisher if I

11814
07:20:34,240 --> 07:20:36,200
decide to put it mid we can still think

11815
07:20:36,200 --> 07:20:39,000
about it it's weird to see sometimes H

11816
07:20:39,000 --> 07:20:41,440
picked into a but I think the purpose is

11817
07:20:41,440 --> 07:20:43,680
is especially like having this insanely

11818
07:20:43,680 --> 07:20:45,798
strong Lanes we can still do Post free

11819
07:20:45,798 --> 07:20:48,040
dazle if we decide I don't know like if

11820
07:20:48,040 --> 07:20:51,638
collabs uh going to play it or not uh

11821
07:20:51,638 --> 07:20:54,360
I'm I'm curious because one hero that

11822
07:20:54,360 --> 07:20:56,240
comes to my mind that both teams

11823
07:20:56,240 --> 07:20:59,798
ignoring uh second I think uh po games

11824
07:20:59,798 --> 07:21:01,680
is Spirit breaker right we all talked

11825
07:21:01,680 --> 07:21:03,638
how imbalanced and broken with hero is

11826
07:21:03,638 --> 07:21:05,878
and now we don't see it much because

11827
07:21:05,878 --> 07:21:07,478
even here I saw okay we have green

11828
07:21:07,478 --> 07:21:09,000
stroke maybe potentially who knows

11829
07:21:09,000 --> 07:21:11,200
there's not so many Heroes to stop it if

11830
07:21:11,200 --> 07:21:13,718
you think about it yeah yeah I can see

11831
07:21:13,718 --> 07:21:15,398
the spear breaker especially since I

11832
07:21:15,398 --> 07:21:16,638
think there's like a mechanic with BR

11833
07:21:16,638 --> 07:21:18,120
Master where the brings take the creep

11834
07:21:18,120 --> 07:21:19,760
damage from the charge so you actually

11835
07:21:19,760 --> 07:21:21,798
kill like over half their HP even after

11836
07:21:21,798 --> 07:21:23,878
brw Master's 20 time one interaction

11837
07:21:23,878 --> 07:21:25,440
with the Dazzle versus a I think swings

11838
07:21:25,440 --> 07:21:26,760
the match up a little bit is you can

11839
07:21:26,760 --> 07:21:29,240
actually perr someone if they get AED

11840
07:21:29,240 --> 07:21:30,840
well as soon as you have 18 on Dazzle so

11841
07:21:30,840 --> 07:21:33,200
it's not as much of like a oh they can

11842
07:21:33,200 --> 07:21:34,958
all in no matter what with this AO on

11843
07:21:34,958 --> 07:21:37,798
one target what do you guys make of uh

11844
07:21:37,798 --> 07:21:39,798
Spirits approach to dealing with gaming

11845
07:21:39,798 --> 07:21:41,398
Gladiators which I mean if you look at

11846
07:21:41,398 --> 07:21:42,840
the game in lineup it seems very team

11847
07:21:42,840 --> 07:21:44,280
fight Centric right you got Pango you

11848
07:21:44,280 --> 07:21:45,920
got brew master Al are you a little

11849
07:21:45,920 --> 07:21:47,958
concerned for gaming Gladiators having

11850
07:21:47,958 --> 07:21:49,478
downtime when they have cool down on

11851
07:21:49,478 --> 07:21:50,958
this uh you look at Spirits lineup it

11852
07:21:50,958 --> 07:21:52,600
seems very fast very low cool down it

11853
07:21:52,600 --> 07:21:55,440
can play in Duos trios uh do you think

11854
07:21:55,440 --> 07:21:57,360
By Design This Dazzle fits that play

11855
07:21:57,360 --> 07:22:00,000
style really well uh for sure and I

11856
07:22:00,000 --> 07:22:02,718
would add up up here that both previous

11857
07:22:02,718 --> 07:22:04,920
game and this game so far uh what

11858
07:22:04,920 --> 07:22:07,440
bothers me in gaming draft is uh we

11859
07:22:07,440 --> 07:22:09,320
don't really have a saves in their

11860
07:22:09,320 --> 07:22:11,080
lineup if you look at team spirit lineup

11861
07:22:11,080 --> 07:22:12,798
where you already have two and usually

11862
07:22:12,798 --> 07:22:15,160
on like middle game late game this is

11863
07:22:15,160 --> 07:22:16,478
one of the most important things that

11864
07:22:16,478 --> 07:22:18,680
you have in your lineups so not only

11865
07:22:18,680 --> 07:22:20,398
like big cool Downs like on bre or

11866
07:22:20,398 --> 07:22:22,320
something like this but also like uh

11867
07:22:22,320 --> 07:22:24,520
saves I think it's often can be like

11868
07:22:24,520 --> 07:22:26,000
Game

11869
07:22:26,000 --> 07:22:29,120
Changer speaking of saves I think Gman

11870
07:22:29,120 --> 07:22:31,760
probably needs to ban C in this game

11871
07:22:31,760 --> 07:22:33,240
this could be a really good hero like

11872
07:22:33,240 --> 07:22:35,398
you see the Roll come out you see the

11873
07:22:35,398 --> 07:22:38,638
split come out some Centaur Stampede can

11874
07:22:38,638 --> 07:22:40,440
disengage that really well I think they

11875
07:22:40,440 --> 07:22:42,080
need another hero that I'm was kind of

11876
07:22:42,080 --> 07:22:43,760
looking at yur's hero pool not seeing

11877
07:22:43,760 --> 07:22:46,200
anything much better versus the brew

11878
07:22:46,200 --> 07:22:48,638
master than the CK right now potentially

11879
07:22:48,638 --> 07:22:49,798
it was like a morphling but then you're

11880
07:22:49,798 --> 07:22:51,840
playing versus AA Weaver's band it's

11881
07:22:51,840 --> 07:22:54,478
like a nightstalker carry yeah I think

11882
07:22:54,478 --> 07:22:56,080
Nightfall pulled out out a couple pits I

11883
07:22:56,080 --> 07:22:57,360
I could actually see yoro playing in a

11884
07:22:57,360 --> 07:22:58,638
game like this it's actually a really

11885
07:22:58,638 --> 07:23:01,240
good night socer carry game

11886
07:23:01,240 --> 07:23:03,920
agree on that that looks amazing if we

11887
07:23:03,920 --> 07:23:05,920
go for it it's very hard to play with

11888
07:23:05,920 --> 07:23:08,040
this lineup so far against ni stalker

11889
07:23:08,040 --> 07:23:10,920
carry you don't have so many uh reliable

11890
07:23:10,920 --> 07:23:13,760
stuns I would say on gladi yet like you

11891
07:23:13,760 --> 07:23:15,120
have a lot of some skill shots that you

11892
07:23:15,120 --> 07:23:18,000
need to aim so it can create a problem

11893
07:23:18,000 --> 07:23:19,718
yeah also by way Grim is also safe if

11894
07:23:19,718 --> 07:23:22,000
you think about it right his Shard is

11895
07:23:22,000 --> 07:23:25,200
used so efficiently at ti so far yeah we

11896
07:23:25,200 --> 07:23:27,240
saw that last game as well like I guess

11897
07:23:27,240 --> 07:23:29,160
the only question is like they probably

11898
07:23:29,160 --> 07:23:31,558
are wanting a range cuz you have tusk

11899
07:23:31,558 --> 07:23:33,798
potentially five and I don't know if CK

11900
07:23:33,798 --> 07:23:35,680
Tusk Lane is going to cut it I guess

11901
07:23:35,680 --> 07:23:37,280
they could do it I think just because

11902
07:23:37,280 --> 07:23:38,638
they see the AA they might feel like

11903
07:23:38,638 --> 07:23:39,958
they can greed it out like they have a

11904
07:23:39,958 --> 07:23:41,080
five that doesn't really prevent the

11905
07:23:41,080 --> 07:23:42,878
carry from getting all in and that can't

11906
07:23:42,878 --> 07:23:44,080
protect themselves so you can like play

11907
07:23:44,080 --> 07:23:45,520
for the kills in with something like the

11908
07:23:45,520 --> 07:23:47,840
CK Tusk I could see them just go for the

11909
07:23:47,840 --> 07:23:49,200
range rout with the tusar 5 though I

11910
07:23:49,200 --> 07:23:50,318
think they'd have really strong lanes

11911
07:23:50,318 --> 07:23:52,478
that way as well it seems like gaming

11912
07:23:52,478 --> 07:23:54,160
gliders have the same mindset with this

11913
07:23:54,160 --> 07:23:55,798
uh Dawn breaker B right this is a hero

11914
07:23:55,798 --> 07:23:57,240
combination that we saw other teams run

11915
07:23:57,240 --> 07:23:59,120
earlier in the tournament the Tusk Dawn

11916
07:23:59,120 --> 07:24:00,360
as a dual Lane just absolutely

11917
07:24:00,360 --> 07:24:03,080
obliterating weak F so it does seem like

11918
07:24:03,080 --> 07:24:05,318
gam are still in that mindset of this CK

11919
07:24:05,318 --> 07:24:07,760
is going to be the carry um but as you

11920
07:24:07,760 --> 07:24:09,280
guys pointed out I don't I don't even

11921
07:24:09,280 --> 07:24:11,040
think CK Tusk is going to struggle here

11922
07:24:11,040 --> 07:24:12,680
unless that carry last pick from gaming

11923
07:24:12,680 --> 07:24:14,718
really solves that lane AA does not like

11924
07:24:14,718 --> 07:24:16,558
this match up honestly I just like this

11925
07:24:16,558 --> 07:24:18,318
last H from T Spirit to sort of solidify

11926
07:24:18,318 --> 07:24:19,680
their team fights I feel like right now

11927
07:24:19,680 --> 07:24:21,240
they actually have a chance that they

11928
07:24:21,240 --> 07:24:22,600
get run over in team fights I think

11929
07:24:22,600 --> 07:24:23,958
Pango brw master and morto are all

11930
07:24:23,958 --> 07:24:26,520
really strong

11931
07:24:26,520 --> 07:24:29,680
oh oh it was time dend he wanted it he

11932
07:24:29,680 --> 07:24:31,718
got it

11933
07:24:31,718 --> 07:24:34,120
oh it's a beautiful lineup here Spirit

11934
07:24:34,120 --> 07:24:36,440
breaker green looks very scary very

11935
07:24:36,440 --> 07:24:39,398
scary also it's a bigy pierce once again

11936
07:24:39,398 --> 07:24:41,878
which is very strong in a lot of

11937
07:24:41,878 --> 07:24:44,360
situations remain yeah I think the carry

11938
07:24:44,360 --> 07:24:46,558
pull I think the troll being banned and

11939
07:24:46,558 --> 07:24:48,520
the void kind of can signify that you

11940
07:24:48,520 --> 07:24:50,440
want this CK to be your carry so they're

11941
07:24:50,440 --> 07:24:51,638
going for the offline rout not going for

11942
07:24:51,638 --> 07:24:53,478
the center going for the spear breaker

11943
07:24:53,478 --> 07:24:54,958
which brew master I guess you have a

11944
07:24:54,958 --> 07:24:56,760
dispel which helps a little bit against

11945
07:24:56,760 --> 07:24:58,398
that if you can get it off on time but

11946
07:24:58,398 --> 07:24:59,638
we've seen time and time again in the

11947
07:24:59,638 --> 07:25:01,478
late game it doesn't really matter you

11948
07:25:01,478 --> 07:25:04,760
have like a bkb oing core and like can

11949
07:25:04,760 --> 07:25:06,440
refresh your orb so you can't really

11950
07:25:06,440 --> 07:25:08,360
deal with that so this has been a

11951
07:25:08,360 --> 07:25:10,200
collapse special throughout like the

11952
07:25:10,200 --> 07:25:12,478
entirety of this TI and he's really good

11953
07:25:12,478 --> 07:25:14,280
at it and it looks pretty scary here I

11954
07:25:14,280 --> 07:25:15,878
will say the game in lineup it looks

11955
07:25:15,878 --> 07:25:17,120
pretty good though so far I think

11956
07:25:17,120 --> 07:25:19,120
whenever you play against Dazzle having

11957
07:25:19,120 --> 07:25:21,040
that AA is really good if you can ever

11958
07:25:21,040 --> 07:25:22,798
commit on

11959
07:25:22,798 --> 07:25:25,280
him we have a spectre going to round it

11960
07:25:25,280 --> 07:25:28,240
out with the Spectre so giving some

11961
07:25:28,240 --> 07:25:29,558
maybe some skirmishing potential to

11962
07:25:29,558 --> 07:25:31,718
gaming glage a a carrier that can join

11963
07:25:31,718 --> 07:25:34,240
globally does this was this just a

11964
07:25:34,240 --> 07:25:36,478
matter of okay there's nothing left or

11965
07:25:36,478 --> 07:25:37,958
is the lane going to be okay is yeah

11966
07:25:37,958 --> 07:25:39,000
honestly I'm really worried for

11967
07:25:39,000 --> 07:25:40,280
gladiators I feel like every time I've

11968
07:25:40,280 --> 07:25:41,920
seen spear breaker have a good Lane this

11969
07:25:41,920 --> 07:25:44,638
hero is like the most unreal Ino of the

11970
07:25:44,638 --> 07:25:47,120
patch yeah Spectre a is one of the best

11971
07:25:47,120 --> 07:25:49,280
combinations in the game for ages and I

11972
07:25:49,280 --> 07:25:51,398
don't think anything changing in that

11973
07:25:51,398 --> 07:25:52,920
because those both Heroes complement

11974
07:25:52,920 --> 07:25:54,760
each other very well but at the same

11975
07:25:54,760 --> 07:25:57,080
time the lineup on team spe looks crazy

11976
07:25:57,080 --> 07:26:01,878
in late game if it's the game d ways

11977
07:26:03,240 --> 07:26:05,200
all right seems like we're grasping are

11978
07:26:05,200 --> 07:26:06,440
we grasping as draws for gaming

11979
07:26:06,440 --> 07:26:08,558
Gladiators is this actually going to be

11980
07:26:08,558 --> 07:26:10,280
that difficult of a safe plane as maybe

11981
07:26:10,280 --> 07:26:12,440
some sort of Hope with rotation from

11982
07:26:12,440 --> 07:26:14,760
maybe a a gating wherea could offset

11983
07:26:14,760 --> 07:26:16,120
this balance in the Top Lane can you

11984
07:26:16,120 --> 07:26:18,000
leave brew master alone for a minute to

11985
07:26:18,000 --> 07:26:20,040
try to help or do you need to get really

11986
07:26:20,040 --> 07:26:21,680
creative I think a lot can happen in

11987
07:26:21,680 --> 07:26:22,760
this game and I think A lot's going to

11988
07:26:22,760 --> 07:26:24,920
come from the mid lane and can Quinn get

11989
07:26:24,920 --> 07:26:26,958
rotations and can they abuse Laurel this

11990
07:26:26,958 --> 07:26:28,280
game cuz I think Laurel is very

11991
07:26:28,280 --> 07:26:30,478
exploitable in this game with a old spec

11992
07:26:30,478 --> 07:26:32,280
old and if he feeds a lot of net worth

11993
07:26:32,280 --> 07:26:33,798
back that could be a way back into the

11994
07:26:33,798 --> 07:26:35,240
game yeah I can completely see that if

11995
07:26:35,240 --> 07:26:37,000
one lane starts to being start getting

11996
07:26:37,000 --> 07:26:38,398
pressured like you have the Spector to

11997
07:26:38,398 --> 07:26:39,958
add on the pengle probably is going to

11998
07:26:39,958 --> 07:26:41,240
be the strongest hero in the game when

11999
07:26:41,240 --> 07:26:43,000
he gets his role so they do have a lot

12000
07:26:43,000 --> 07:26:45,398
of angles on Gladiator to snowball off

12001
07:26:45,398 --> 07:26:47,840
that so I guess I mean not to sound like

12002
07:26:47,840 --> 07:26:49,718
a broken record but we are uh we're very

12003
07:26:49,718 --> 07:26:51,160
focused on the Leaning stage as per

12004
07:26:51,160 --> 07:26:54,878
usual in this series um if you're in

12005
07:26:54,878 --> 07:26:56,718
Quinn's shoes in this game obviously

12006
07:26:56,718 --> 07:26:58,200
you've had a couple of games that were

12007
07:26:58,200 --> 07:27:00,040
did not go according to plan right are

12008
07:27:00,040 --> 07:27:02,040
you you let's talk a little bit about

12009
07:27:02,040 --> 07:27:03,638
the mentality of him going up against

12010
07:27:03,638 --> 07:27:05,240
what we assume will be a very

12011
07:27:05,240 --> 07:27:07,080
unfavorable match up against laurl and

12012
07:27:07,080 --> 07:27:08,718
The Dazzle what do you think Quinn is

12013
07:27:08,718 --> 07:27:09,958
telling his team right now is it all

12014
07:27:09,958 --> 07:27:11,120
right I'm going to be struggling but

12015
07:27:11,120 --> 07:27:13,760
I'll come back or I need help for sure

12016
07:27:13,760 --> 07:27:15,680
in this game it's actually not that bad

12017
07:27:15,680 --> 07:27:18,840
for Pango it's one of a better Heroes to

12018
07:27:18,840 --> 07:27:20,398
uh sustain against dazzle because he

12019
07:27:20,398 --> 07:27:22,120
have two jumps to jump away from its

12020
07:27:22,120 --> 07:27:24,398
poison attacks so I think Queen is

12021
07:27:24,398 --> 07:27:25,798
extremely experienced and he will be

12022
07:27:25,798 --> 07:27:28,478
fine all right guys gaming Gladiators

12023
07:27:28,478 --> 07:27:30,200
they are on the ropes I'm sure team

12024
07:27:30,200 --> 07:27:31,840
Spirit of feeling themselves right now

12025
07:27:31,840 --> 07:27:33,318
and let's see if it is the same for

12026
07:27:33,318 --> 07:27:34,680
their coach

12027
07:27:34,680 --> 07:27:37,878
silent thank you very much I am joined

12028
07:27:37,878 --> 07:27:41,280
by silent of team spirit where around

12029
07:27:41,280 --> 07:27:43,878
two years ago you were in a very similar

12030
07:27:43,878 --> 07:27:46,318
spot it was Grand finals TI 10 in

12031
07:27:46,318 --> 07:27:49,160
Bucharest you were up two games now a

12032
07:27:49,160 --> 07:27:51,558
lot has changed since then but hasn't

12033
07:27:51,558 --> 07:27:53,558
changed for your team the energy from

12034
07:27:53,558 --> 07:27:55,958
two years ago to now does anything feel

12035
07:27:55,958 --> 07:27:59,000
different uh no I think uh we feel the

12036
07:27:59,000 --> 07:28:01,040
same you need to be be focused and play

12037
07:28:01,040 --> 07:28:03,398
till the end it doesn't matter lead you

12038
07:28:03,398 --> 07:28:07,638
or losing same you don't like to okay we

12039
07:28:07,638 --> 07:28:11,798
leading to Z we can make some YOLO plays

12040
07:28:11,798 --> 07:28:13,798
a championship mentality through and

12041
07:28:13,798 --> 07:28:15,600
through but I know one thing that's

12042
07:28:15,600 --> 07:28:18,398
different two years ago you didn't have

12043
07:28:18,398 --> 07:28:19,318
a

12044
07:28:19,318 --> 07:28:23,000
crowd but this

12045
07:28:26,798 --> 07:28:29,040
time I think they're ready for a game

12046
07:28:29,040 --> 07:28:32,040
number three

12047
07:28:36,520 --> 07:28:38,600
and we are certainly ready for a game

12048
07:28:38,600 --> 07:28:41,240
number three though we certainly don't

12049
07:28:41,240 --> 07:28:43,958
want to end it here Seattle do we want

12050
07:28:43,958 --> 07:28:46,718
to see some more

12051
07:28:47,638 --> 07:28:50,958
DOTA here in the cathedral in Seattle we

12052
07:28:50,958 --> 07:28:52,878
may just be witnessing the final game of

12053
07:28:52,878 --> 07:28:54,840
the grand finals but I'm sure a lot of

12054
07:28:54,840 --> 07:28:57,360
us hope for so much more and that all

12055
07:28:57,360 --> 07:29:00,360
depends on game and gladiators I mean

12056
07:29:00,360 --> 07:29:01,840
they have been the ones to run the

12057
07:29:01,840 --> 07:29:03,240
gauntlet through all of these Majors

12058
07:29:03,240 --> 07:29:04,878
they were looking like the best team of

12059
07:29:04,878 --> 07:29:08,638
the year until they ran into team spirit

12060
07:29:08,638 --> 07:29:11,718
until team spirit ramped up in just the

12061
07:29:11,718 --> 07:29:14,958
right time shown up for championships

12062
07:29:14,958 --> 07:29:17,718
and they have only lost two games in

12063
07:29:17,718 --> 07:29:20,240
this entire tournament Avery they are 43

12064
07:29:20,240 --> 07:29:23,360
and seven in their last 50 this team is

12065
07:29:23,360 --> 07:29:25,160
looking Unstoppable is there anything

12066
07:29:25,160 --> 07:29:28,360
gaming Gladiators can do to Halt this

12067
07:29:28,360 --> 07:29:30,558
momentum even just a little bit

12068
07:29:30,558 --> 07:29:32,000
you have to play DotA there's no way

12069
07:29:32,000 --> 07:29:33,840
around it you have to meet this team on

12070
07:29:33,840 --> 07:29:36,000
their plane and give them a taste of

12071
07:29:36,000 --> 07:29:37,520
their own medicine because you came in

12072
07:29:37,520 --> 07:29:38,760
with a plan but everybody has a plan

12073
07:29:38,760 --> 07:29:40,680
until team spear punches you in the face

12074
07:29:40,680 --> 07:29:41,760
and right now you're laying on the

12075
07:29:41,760 --> 07:29:42,760
ground trying to figure out what the

12076
07:29:42,760 --> 07:29:43,958
hell just happened in the first two

12077
07:29:43,958 --> 07:29:46,478
games your plan did not work whatever

12078
07:29:46,478 --> 07:29:47,520
you thought it was going to happen in

12079
07:29:47,520 --> 07:29:50,040
the games one and two it fell flat so

12080
07:29:50,040 --> 07:29:51,600
right now team spirit are in control of

12081
07:29:51,600 --> 07:29:53,120
this draft meta they're in control of

12082
07:29:53,120 --> 07:29:54,680
the series and they're dictating the

12083
07:29:54,680 --> 07:29:55,798
pace in these games they're dictating

12084
07:29:55,798 --> 07:29:57,558
the team fight so you have to meet them

12085
07:29:57,558 --> 07:29:59,478
there and beat them you have to outplay

12086
07:29:59,478 --> 07:30:00,478
them you have to start winning these

12087
07:30:00,478 --> 07:30:02,200
team fights scaling into the late game

12088
07:30:02,200 --> 07:30:04,520
you are not going to run this team over

12089
07:30:04,520 --> 07:30:06,680
which means you got to find some more

12090
07:30:06,680 --> 07:30:08,558
momentum going past that 30 or 40 minute

12091
07:30:08,558 --> 07:30:10,440
Mark it's not been gamon's Mo this

12092
07:30:10,440 --> 07:30:12,760
entire low bracket run but hey you're in

12093
07:30:12,760 --> 07:30:14,840
a dire situation at Grand F you don't

12094
07:30:14,840 --> 07:30:17,638
have another chance here you are at the

12095
07:30:17,638 --> 07:30:20,318
total limit so figure it out fast make

12096
07:30:20,318 --> 07:30:22,280
the adjustments and get crank and this

12097
07:30:22,280 --> 07:30:24,280
is a draft that is heading in that

12098
07:30:24,280 --> 07:30:25,878
direction right a lot more team fight a

12099
07:30:25,878 --> 07:30:28,318
lot more scaling presence Spectre AA

12100
07:30:28,318 --> 07:30:30,520
here designed to put you in a tough

12101
07:30:30,520 --> 07:30:32,080
position we've seen the AA a counter to

12102
07:30:32,080 --> 07:30:33,600
CK for a lot of this tournament in terms

12103
07:30:33,600 --> 07:30:35,600
of limiting the life steal interactions

12104
07:30:35,600 --> 07:30:37,200
of course it can also have a huge impact

12105
07:30:37,200 --> 07:30:38,440
versus The Dazzle as this game

12106
07:30:38,440 --> 07:30:40,280
progresses into the late game so I think

12107
07:30:40,280 --> 07:30:42,040
these are much more even lineups in

12108
07:30:42,040 --> 07:30:43,920
terms of what happens past the 40 or 50

12109
07:30:43,920 --> 07:30:45,398
minute Mark there's not some crazy

12110
07:30:45,398 --> 07:30:47,040
inevitable scale outside of maybe Dazzle

12111
07:30:47,040 --> 07:30:49,200
Spirit breaker doing crazy Dazzle Spirit

12112
07:30:49,200 --> 07:30:51,360
breaker things and celer trouble in the

12113
07:30:51,360 --> 07:30:53,200
bottom Lane and that is going to be your

12114
07:30:53,200 --> 07:30:56,200
first Blood collapse claim it with a

12115
07:30:56,200 --> 07:30:58,958
bash of course a little luck goes a long

12116
07:30:58,958 --> 07:31:01,040
way a classic team Spirit strategy going

12117
07:31:01,040 --> 07:31:04,360
back to their first TI Victory and a c

12118
07:31:04,360 --> 07:31:05,840
Courier pick off as well look at that

12119
07:31:05,840 --> 07:31:08,440
dagio even like taking himself outside

12120
07:31:08,440 --> 07:31:10,120
the lane to block the hard Camp cuz this

12121
07:31:10,120 --> 07:31:11,760
Lane is already going a little bit

12122
07:31:11,760 --> 07:31:14,000
awkward for them the mid Lanes not

12123
07:31:14,000 --> 07:31:16,600
looking much better we 12 and four on

12124
07:31:16,600 --> 07:31:18,558
Laurel over this melee range versus

12125
07:31:18,558 --> 07:31:20,520
melee match up it's not a fun one you

12126
07:31:20,520 --> 07:31:22,318
should expect the Dazzle to win but

12127
07:31:22,318 --> 07:31:24,638
Laurel is already taking commanding lead

12128
07:31:24,638 --> 07:31:26,840
and then we've got your Toro 11 and two

12129
07:31:26,840 --> 07:31:29,160
now the brew master is keeping Pace but

12130
07:31:29,160 --> 07:31:30,638
he's certainly not slowing down the

12131
07:31:30,638 --> 07:31:32,080
carry of team spirit so gaming

12132
07:31:32,080 --> 07:31:34,440
Gladiators got to be able to to uh Hal

12133
07:31:34,440 --> 07:31:37,360
this momentum a little bit further here

12134
07:31:37,360 --> 07:31:40,440
bit of damage onto Ace they turning it

12135
07:31:40,440 --> 07:31:43,120
back around but goou is here to be able

12136
07:31:43,120 --> 07:31:44,680
to help him out nice shot to get the

12137
07:31:44,680 --> 07:31:47,318
extra bit of damage on two Heroes yeah

12138
07:31:47,318 --> 07:31:49,680
double proc win the war of attrition I

12139
07:31:49,680 --> 07:31:51,520
think these sings can go fine for gaming

12140
07:31:51,520 --> 07:31:53,120
over the course of the lanes they don't

12141
07:31:53,120 --> 07:31:54,878
look too terrifying to me I think the

12142
07:31:54,878 --> 07:31:56,520
Brew can fight back with the help of

12143
07:31:56,520 --> 07:31:58,200
morta just a very tough hero to trade

12144
07:31:58,200 --> 07:32:00,120
into that mid Lan is what I'm wored out

12145
07:32:00,120 --> 07:32:01,680
the right it's Dazzle versus melee I

12146
07:32:01,680 --> 07:32:03,558
mean pangle has some Escape mechanisms

12147
07:32:03,558 --> 07:32:05,240
but if you get some Ram going through

12148
07:32:05,240 --> 07:32:07,558
with the poison adding up can be deadly

12149
07:32:07,558 --> 07:32:09,280
every single time Cel wants to be able

12150
07:32:09,280 --> 07:32:11,718
to stop that hard Camp opportunity he

12151
07:32:11,718 --> 07:32:13,920
does risk Getting Gone on by meor and

12152
07:32:13,920 --> 07:32:15,638
collapse this time around he's fine The

12153
07:32:15,638 --> 07:32:17,760
Shard inadvertently kind of helps him

12154
07:32:17,760 --> 07:32:20,240
out as he's pushed underneath his Tower

12155
07:32:20,240 --> 07:32:21,680
just try and get as many pulls off space

12156
07:32:21,680 --> 07:32:23,718
as you can in this Lane boost the XP up

12157
07:32:23,718 --> 07:32:25,520
for both Heroes as they both really want

12158
07:32:25,520 --> 07:32:27,160
and need it here you're not going to be

12159
07:32:27,160 --> 07:32:29,160
able to shut collapse down which I mean

12160
07:32:29,160 --> 07:32:30,360
that's a worrying fact Factor right a

12161
07:32:30,360 --> 07:32:32,120
spear breaker with absolute free F it's

12162
07:32:32,120 --> 07:32:34,160
going to have a fast Midas is what

12163
07:32:34,160 --> 07:32:35,360
collapse is going to have here he's

12164
07:32:35,360 --> 07:32:38,080
going to have his choice and it'll be

12165
07:32:38,080 --> 07:32:39,920
quite powerful going into that mid game

12166
07:32:39,920 --> 07:32:41,318
so you got to be able to strike back in

12167
07:32:41,318 --> 07:32:42,920
these small skirmishes get the ults up

12168
07:32:42,920 --> 07:32:44,240
particularly the brew master Primal

12169
07:32:44,240 --> 07:32:46,000
split the Rolling Thunder here very

12170
07:32:46,000 --> 07:32:48,360
powerful spells if you can get them fast

12171
07:32:48,360 --> 07:32:50,080
and of course a blast coming in on top

12172
07:32:50,080 --> 07:32:51,840
of it with Vortex amping up all this

12173
07:32:51,840 --> 07:32:55,360
magic damage and put that mini haunt to

12174
07:32:55,360 --> 07:32:57,840
use on the

12175
07:32:57,840 --> 07:33:00,080
step real quickly when to give it a

12176
07:33:00,080 --> 07:33:01,398
shout out to our observers our

12177
07:33:01,398 --> 07:33:03,080
hardworking observers who have been

12178
07:33:03,080 --> 07:33:04,958
keeping us through this entire

12179
07:33:04,958 --> 07:33:07,478
tournament Ace may be in some trouble

12180
07:33:07,478 --> 07:33:09,920
here moska he's trying to dodge all of

12181
07:33:09,920 --> 07:33:10,920
these ghosts he doesn't want to leave

12182
07:33:10,920 --> 07:33:12,318
the calling he'll take that extra bit of

12183
07:33:12,318 --> 07:33:14,200
damage to try and risk it but he does

12184
07:33:14,200 --> 07:33:16,718
end up falling as a result and now Ace

12185
07:33:16,718 --> 07:33:18,360
he'll have some helping in from tofu

12186
07:33:18,360 --> 07:33:20,080
beautiful dead shot to push him back in

12187
07:33:20,080 --> 07:33:22,840
and gaining Gladiators a very clutch

12188
07:33:22,840 --> 07:33:25,638
fight there for them tofu and Ace get a

12189
07:33:25,638 --> 07:33:27,600
big win in their off Lane that's the

12190
07:33:27,600 --> 07:33:28,840
strength of the mor at the Dual Lane

12191
07:33:28,840 --> 07:33:30,240
that they're looking for this is her has

12192
07:33:30,240 --> 07:33:31,840
been a first pick for them for a lot of

12193
07:33:31,840 --> 07:33:34,000
these series they're very confident in

12194
07:33:34,000 --> 07:33:35,920
what tofu can do on it in the early game

12195
07:33:35,920 --> 07:33:38,200
and now he has some roam options I don't

12196
07:33:38,200 --> 07:33:39,478
think you can leave Ace in the one on

12197
07:33:39,478 --> 07:33:40,478
two but if you can get some breathing

12198
07:33:40,478 --> 07:33:41,878
room like this and look towards mid

12199
07:33:41,878 --> 07:33:43,440
maybe you can get some damage poke help

12200
07:33:43,440 --> 07:33:46,040
skew this Lane back in Quinn's favor cuz

12201
07:33:46,040 --> 07:33:48,318
he is still getting known 31 and 10 on

12202
07:33:48,318 --> 07:33:50,200
Laurel almost doubling Quinn up here he

12203
07:33:50,200 --> 07:33:52,440
got The Courier as well Quinn with a

12204
07:33:52,440 --> 07:33:54,840
slight misstep will hurt his regen

12205
07:33:54,840 --> 07:33:56,840
fairing that just means more pressure

12206
07:33:56,840 --> 07:33:58,798
going to build up between Laurel and his

12207
07:33:58,798 --> 07:34:01,000
melee foe just not much you can do

12208
07:34:01,000 --> 07:34:04,000
against the poison touch here yeah this

12209
07:34:04,000 --> 07:34:05,360
is looking like Quinn kind of needs one

12210
07:34:05,360 --> 07:34:07,040
of his supports to die just to refill

12211
07:34:07,040 --> 07:34:08,920
that bottle and celery May Grant him

12212
07:34:08,920 --> 07:34:10,200
that wish he's going to get a double

12213
07:34:10,200 --> 07:34:12,318
blood grenade before he goes so this may

12214
07:34:12,318 --> 07:34:14,318
be a fair tradeoff if Dau can claim his

12215
07:34:14,318 --> 07:34:16,318
life and he does manage to get it it

12216
07:34:16,318 --> 07:34:18,558
puts an early level into that desolate

12217
07:34:18,558 --> 07:34:20,680
and it's just the added damage they need

12218
07:34:20,680 --> 07:34:22,600
honestly I think celer is okay with that

12219
07:34:22,600 --> 07:34:25,240
solo XP for Dau on a spectre he gets to

12220
07:34:25,240 --> 07:34:26,840
collect all these creeps under the tower

12221
07:34:26,840 --> 07:34:27,878
without any

12222
07:34:27,878 --> 07:34:29,718
pressure pretty happy about that

12223
07:34:29,718 --> 07:34:31,558
exchange with a very defensive oriented

12224
07:34:31,558 --> 07:34:33,120
Lane where I mean you know what are you

12225
07:34:33,120 --> 07:34:34,638
doing aggressively with the a Spector

12226
07:34:34,638 --> 07:34:36,240
it's all about getting farm and XP down

12227
07:34:36,240 --> 07:34:38,080
here and there's that TP rotation to

12228
07:34:38,080 --> 07:34:40,398
fill out Quinn's bottle and try and help

12229
07:34:40,398 --> 07:34:42,318
with the six-minute Rune see if he's

12230
07:34:42,318 --> 07:34:43,920
able to do so but team spirit not going

12231
07:34:43,920 --> 07:34:45,600
to worry about the runes here instead

12232
07:34:45,600 --> 07:34:47,398
they try and win this off Lane situation

12233
07:34:47,398 --> 07:34:48,840
where Ace and too were doing pretty well

12234
07:34:48,840 --> 07:34:50,240
for themselves they bring three Heroes

12235
07:34:50,240 --> 07:34:52,080
to the matter to bring down Ace if they

12236
07:34:52,080 --> 07:34:53,398
can get him slowed down by the blood

12237
07:34:53,398 --> 07:34:54,638
grenade they only need a couple more

12238
07:34:54,638 --> 07:34:56,600
hits they've got more blood where that

12239
07:34:56,600 --> 07:34:58,318
came from apparently gives them over

12240
07:34:58,318 --> 07:35:00,600
that Lotus and that's enough

12241
07:35:00,600 --> 07:35:02,398
evasion with the haze enough for Ace to

12242
07:35:02,398 --> 07:35:04,478
just walk him off here Okay I lied they

12243
07:35:04,478 --> 07:35:06,840
do care about that uh that power Rune

12244
07:35:06,840 --> 07:35:08,520
because they brought collapse to secure

12245
07:35:08,520 --> 07:35:10,520
it not just that but also the kill on

12246
07:35:10,520 --> 07:35:12,200
Quinn that's just going to secure the

12247
07:35:12,200 --> 07:35:13,520
double check for L he's going to walk

12248
07:35:13,520 --> 07:35:15,000
all the way top and get himself a shield

12249
07:35:15,000 --> 07:35:17,000
Rune putting this match up to good use

12250
07:35:17,000 --> 07:35:18,680
giving Quinn a taste of his own medicine

12251
07:35:18,680 --> 07:35:20,120
here with the Rome maybe not expected

12252
07:35:20,120 --> 07:35:21,920
out of the off laner but that is a hell

12253
07:35:21,920 --> 07:35:23,558
of a rotation from collapse and gets a

12254
07:35:23,558 --> 07:35:25,080
lot of momentum going to this Dazzle

12255
07:35:25,080 --> 07:35:26,798
right now this is a pressure point

12256
07:35:26,798 --> 07:35:28,600
you're going to have to respond to this

12257
07:35:28,600 --> 07:35:30,798
is a hero that scales very hard in Dota

12258
07:35:30,798 --> 07:35:32,958
right

12259
07:35:33,240 --> 07:35:35,638
now pretty strong early game for team

12260
07:35:35,638 --> 07:35:37,280
spirit they're going to look to try and

12261
07:35:37,280 --> 07:35:38,878
play back but Quinn with a nice rotation

12262
07:35:38,878 --> 07:35:41,718
just eyeing yoro up here all alone will

12263
07:35:41,718 --> 07:35:43,600
get the hit back if you're just going to

12264
07:35:43,600 --> 07:35:45,680
keep dying in your lane you might as

12265
07:35:45,680 --> 07:35:47,280
well rotate out of it even if it means

12266
07:35:47,280 --> 07:35:49,760
you're doing it pre-level six so as you

12267
07:35:49,760 --> 07:35:51,280
can see anybody who shows up in the mid

12268
07:35:51,280 --> 07:35:53,638
lane is going to be run over by the

12269
07:35:53,638 --> 07:35:55,160
dazzel especially if you get the extra

12270
07:35:55,160 --> 07:35:57,280
vision of like a TS snowball or the

12271
07:35:57,280 --> 07:35:59,280
spirit breaker charge you just can't get

12272
07:35:59,280 --> 07:36:01,638
away from this poison touch hit so no

12273
07:36:01,638 --> 07:36:02,958
especially with these Wards behind the

12274
07:36:02,958 --> 07:36:05,200
tower already deep Observer for team SP

12275
07:36:05,200 --> 07:36:07,798
behind game in tier one claps having

12276
07:36:07,798 --> 07:36:10,558
chuckle about that yeah that was all

12277
07:36:10,558 --> 07:36:12,000
because Quinn tipped him before the

12278
07:36:12,000 --> 07:36:14,040
charge even completed Quinn knew what

12279
07:36:14,040 --> 07:36:15,798
was coming he could do nothing to stop

12280
07:36:15,798 --> 07:36:17,760
it

12281
07:36:17,760 --> 07:36:20,200
well could have picked a real

12282
07:36:20,200 --> 07:36:24,040
hero always an option just saying 4 to

12283
07:36:24,040 --> 07:36:26,680
four 7 and 1/2 minutes in did we trade

12284
07:36:26,680 --> 07:36:28,718
off wisdom runes yeah yes that was the

12285
07:36:28,718 --> 07:36:30,440
one upside of you know then going on Mid

12286
07:36:30,440 --> 07:36:31,600
you guarantee the wizard Moon trade

12287
07:36:31,600 --> 07:36:33,558
which C is definitely happy about you're

12288
07:36:33,558 --> 07:36:35,360
saying he's like happy to soak up XP but

12289
07:36:35,360 --> 07:36:36,958
it is a weird position for an AA who

12290
07:36:36,958 --> 07:36:38,798
rather just be pulling if nothing else

12291
07:36:38,798 --> 07:36:40,798
is happening Le da alone at the bottom

12292
07:36:40,798 --> 07:36:42,478
Lane but a really good use of the dagger

12293
07:36:42,478 --> 07:36:44,040
will get him over that little Cliff area

12294
07:36:44,040 --> 07:36:46,200
and tofu can get some damage back in

12295
07:36:46,200 --> 07:36:48,318
return no threat of anybody dying but a

12296
07:36:48,318 --> 07:36:50,318
decent punish and will allow Dau to

12297
07:36:50,318 --> 07:36:52,520
clean up some CS but he is being pushed

12298
07:36:52,520 --> 07:36:54,440
out of Lane Mira's not giving up on it

12299
07:36:54,440 --> 07:36:56,878
just yet and aosa even rotating down

12300
07:36:56,878 --> 07:36:58,798
here potentially throwing that ink swell

12301
07:36:58,798 --> 07:37:00,318
into the break I mean this is a

12302
07:37:00,318 --> 07:37:01,920
combination we also saw when breaker was

12303
07:37:01,920 --> 07:37:03,638
hot that last patch the team spear were

12304
07:37:03,638 --> 07:37:05,360
very comfortable playing the ink swell

12305
07:37:05,360 --> 07:37:07,398
breaker across the map giving you the

12306
07:37:07,398 --> 07:37:09,200
guaranteed setup this is what the CK has

12307
07:37:09,200 --> 07:37:11,080
designed to help facilitate push the

12308
07:37:11,080 --> 07:37:13,398
lanes in with CK Illusions be a ghost on

12309
07:37:13,398 --> 07:37:15,200
the map and all of a sudden you get one

12310
07:37:15,200 --> 07:37:16,878
pick off and your map just collapses

12311
07:37:16,878 --> 07:37:18,440
right on the flip side gaming trying to

12312
07:37:18,440 --> 07:37:20,160
do something similar if you can set

12313
07:37:20,160 --> 07:37:22,240
anything up with a primal split or the

12314
07:37:22,240 --> 07:37:24,240
Rolling Thunder then suddenly Dau can

12315
07:37:24,240 --> 07:37:25,958
come in and clean house and this is a

12316
07:37:25,958 --> 07:37:28,398
smoke designed to find yoro but nobody's

12317
07:37:28,398 --> 07:37:31,040
home Toro they Duke him out with the

12318
07:37:31,040 --> 07:37:34,120
fantasm he's sent it back instead Quinn

12319
07:37:34,120 --> 07:37:35,600
and Ace will bite down on that but it

12320
07:37:35,600 --> 07:37:37,000
doesn't matter too much that bait they

12321
07:37:37,000 --> 07:37:38,878
still get some pretty good damage onto

12322
07:37:38,878 --> 07:37:41,318
the tower one thing to note about that

12323
07:37:41,318 --> 07:37:43,398
uh ink swell combination with the spirit

12324
07:37:43,398 --> 07:37:45,840
breaker oh thought they we going to go

12325
07:37:45,840 --> 07:37:47,760
on to mea but mea's going through the

12326
07:37:47,760 --> 07:37:49,160
portal they don't have a stun to stop

12327
07:37:49,160 --> 07:37:51,798
him he gets the other side Daio pursues

12328
07:37:51,798 --> 07:37:53,798
dagger does hit him yeah he's pretty

12329
07:37:53,798 --> 07:37:55,160
damn slow and he's going to hit him with

12330
07:37:55,160 --> 07:37:57,638
another dagger mea he needs the help

12331
07:37:57,638 --> 07:37:59,200
from the spirit breaker has a snowball

12332
07:37:59,200 --> 07:38:02,120
to by a Moment collaps pops ultimate

12333
07:38:02,120 --> 07:38:03,478
immediately goes for the kill on of tofu

12334
07:38:03,478 --> 07:38:04,638
see if they can trade things out here

12335
07:38:04,638 --> 07:38:06,360
for The Shard and the calling that

12336
07:38:06,360 --> 07:38:08,240
actually protects him there collapse

12337
07:38:08,240 --> 07:38:10,280
doesn't want to trade two for one so

12338
07:38:10,280 --> 07:38:11,558
he's going to go ahead and give up on

12339
07:38:11,558 --> 07:38:13,160
that they cannot afford to give any more

12340
07:38:13,160 --> 07:38:15,040
kills to this Daio Spectre going to

12341
07:38:15,040 --> 07:38:16,920
rotate LL bottom they really want to

12342
07:38:16,920 --> 07:38:17,878
punish the

12343
07:38:17,878 --> 07:38:21,120
Rio coming back Inkwell charge in

12344
07:38:21,120 --> 07:38:23,878
chaining the stuns and adding up on the

12345
07:38:23,878 --> 07:38:26,958
damage spear breaker got that 5% buff

12346
07:38:26,958 --> 07:38:29,000
the movement speed as damage got buffed

12347
07:38:29,000 --> 07:38:31,558
up by 5% that was enough to bring him

12348
07:38:31,558 --> 07:38:33,318
back into the meta but then that's even

12349
07:38:33,318 --> 07:38:34,958
more if you add in this ink swell

12350
07:38:34,958 --> 07:38:36,600
movement speed buff uh it's a deadly

12351
07:38:36,600 --> 07:38:38,120
combination for a reason I like that

12352
07:38:38,120 --> 07:38:40,000
rotation from lur that's such a heads up

12353
07:38:40,000 --> 07:38:41,398
read there you just walk down the lane

12354
07:38:41,398 --> 07:38:43,600
there's no vision here they probably had

12355
07:38:43,600 --> 07:38:45,600
a read Because seler's been mid the

12356
07:38:45,600 --> 07:38:47,080
whole time right it's going to limit

12357
07:38:47,080 --> 07:38:48,638
where your observers are going to go

12358
07:38:48,638 --> 07:38:49,958
just gets a really cheeky kill on the

12359
07:38:49,958 --> 07:38:52,120
Spectre nice Shard to buy some time good

12360
07:38:52,120 --> 07:38:54,040
driving by Quinn gets a around that

12361
07:38:54,040 --> 07:38:55,840
little speed bump in the way hopefully

12362
07:38:55,840 --> 07:38:57,760
Dao can finish him up but not quite no

12363
07:38:57,760 --> 07:38:59,840
sh grave comes in for La per timing

12364
07:38:59,840 --> 07:39:01,120
there Quinn does manage to get some

12365
07:39:01,120 --> 07:39:03,920
decent damage Ono and here he makes the

12366
07:39:03,920 --> 07:39:05,478
difference he makes it so team spirit

12367
07:39:05,478 --> 07:39:06,920
can no longer fight bad it's an

12368
07:39:06,920 --> 07:39:08,600
overwhelming amount of Team fight that

12369
07:39:08,600 --> 07:39:10,798
he'll put to work to bring down utoro

12370
07:39:10,798 --> 07:39:12,000
and looks like he's going to chase down

12371
07:39:12,000 --> 07:39:14,638
butka Mira really trying for this one he

12372
07:39:14,638 --> 07:39:16,040
might just get himself kill in the

12373
07:39:16,040 --> 07:39:18,240
process will it be good enough but boska

12374
07:39:18,240 --> 07:39:20,240
still dies and sure enough mea he's

12375
07:39:20,240 --> 07:39:21,920
going to be in trouble as well good use

12376
07:39:21,920 --> 07:39:23,798
of The Shard blocking him out but he

12377
07:39:23,798 --> 07:39:26,798
still Falls cannot stop gaming

12378
07:39:26,798 --> 07:39:29,558
Gladiators as they bring all five Lear

12379
07:39:29,558 --> 07:39:31,760
from team spirit perhaps the only way to

12380
07:39:31,760 --> 07:39:33,240
beat these guys in a team fight is you

12381
07:39:33,240 --> 07:39:35,120
got to bring everybody to the table and

12382
07:39:35,120 --> 07:39:36,318
that's why I think this draft feels a

12383
07:39:36,318 --> 07:39:37,520
lot better for them to play they can

12384
07:39:37,520 --> 07:39:39,360
connect the heroes a lot faster the

12385
07:39:39,360 --> 07:39:41,240
Spectre facilitates that at a tremendous

12386
07:39:41,240 --> 07:39:42,840
rate and then Ace is just on a hero

12387
07:39:42,840 --> 07:39:44,120
where even if his laning phase wasn't

12388
07:39:44,120 --> 07:39:45,920
spectacular which it has been this game

12389
07:39:45,920 --> 07:39:47,558
that Primal split into a fast Radiance

12390
07:39:47,558 --> 07:39:48,798
is going to give him all the team fight

12391
07:39:48,798 --> 07:39:50,600
they need this CK does not have free

12392
07:39:50,600 --> 07:39:52,080
engagements where I felt like in the

12393
07:39:52,080 --> 07:39:53,840
first two games yoro connections were

12394
07:39:53,840 --> 07:39:55,718
uncounted right he goes in with a weaver

12395
07:39:55,718 --> 07:39:57,318
goes in with a fa for gets what he wants

12396
07:39:57,318 --> 07:39:59,760
and gets out this game yoro finds

12397
07:39:59,760 --> 07:40:01,478
himself in a pickle mid where he just

12398
07:40:01,478 --> 07:40:03,478
can't escape pays the price and 0 and

12399
07:40:03,478 --> 07:40:07,000
three start for yoro got up here perhaps

12400
07:40:07,000 --> 07:40:08,240
one of the rougher early games we've

12401
07:40:08,240 --> 07:40:09,680
seen from the entire tournament that is

12402
07:40:09,680 --> 07:40:12,240
a very good position for Gman to be in

12403
07:40:12,240 --> 07:40:13,878
going to shut down a lot of the pace

12404
07:40:13,878 --> 07:40:15,718
ll's going to have to to pick up that

12405
07:40:15,718 --> 07:40:17,040
that little bit of slack right he's

12406
07:40:17,040 --> 07:40:18,360
going to have to step in with this

12407
07:40:18,360 --> 07:40:21,080
Dazzle but the Dazzle I feel like isn't

12408
07:40:21,080 --> 07:40:23,120
a hero you you really want to utilize

12409
07:40:23,120 --> 07:40:25,440
just yet feels like that Agony sceptor

12410
07:40:25,440 --> 07:40:27,318
is such a key timing you can't afford to

12411
07:40:27,318 --> 07:40:29,558
delay that by getting into some RIS

12412
07:40:29,558 --> 07:40:31,760
engagement and this hero is like Tinker

12413
07:40:31,760 --> 07:40:34,240
in some ways I guess first item kind of

12414
07:40:34,240 --> 07:40:35,600
easy to get to you're a Powerhouse when

12415
07:40:35,600 --> 07:40:36,798
you get it but then you fall into a

12416
07:40:36,798 --> 07:40:38,080
valley and it's like the next two or

12417
07:40:38,080 --> 07:40:39,280
three you have to get through before you

12418
07:40:39,280 --> 07:40:41,000
really come online the ultra late and

12419
07:40:41,000 --> 07:40:42,080
those team fights start to become

12420
07:40:42,080 --> 07:40:43,760
impossible for the enemy that is a

12421
07:40:43,760 --> 07:40:45,280
period where gaming can strike with this

12422
07:40:45,280 --> 07:40:46,840
Radiance which is going to be coming out

12423
07:40:46,840 --> 07:40:49,680
fast on Ace this game and just take the

12424
07:40:49,680 --> 07:40:51,520
team fight to team spirit which is where

12425
07:40:51,520 --> 07:40:53,318
again you have to meet this team you

12426
07:40:53,318 --> 07:40:54,600
have to be willing to take the F on

12427
07:40:54,600 --> 07:40:56,398
fives and win them and translate it into

12428
07:40:56,398 --> 07:40:57,638
objectives you can't just go for the

12429
07:40:57,638 --> 07:40:59,558
other first

12430
07:40:59,558 --> 07:41:01,478
smoke across the map they failed to get

12431
07:41:01,478 --> 07:41:02,958
the initiation on collapse we're going

12432
07:41:02,958 --> 07:41:04,398
to try and join Quinn for the power run

12433
07:41:04,398 --> 07:41:05,878
Quinn's going to need that help too he

12434
07:41:05,878 --> 07:41:07,558
silenced up the poison touch the Wells

12435
07:41:07,558 --> 07:41:08,638
on top of him but he does manage to get

12436
07:41:08,638 --> 07:41:10,040
away with the swashbuckle just in time

12437
07:41:10,040 --> 07:41:12,318
the charge is going to complete collapse

12438
07:41:12,318 --> 07:41:13,798
he's got his ultimate he may not even

12439
07:41:13,798 --> 07:41:15,440
need it though the point touch Flo him

12440
07:41:15,440 --> 07:41:17,280
down so much and Mos is getting a TP out

12441
07:41:17,280 --> 07:41:20,638
the shot oh was so close but it runs out

12442
07:41:20,638 --> 07:41:22,440
it doesn't get there in time and now a

12443
07:41:22,440 --> 07:41:24,760
snowball to the other side to meet sario

12444
07:41:24,760 --> 07:41:27,200
as it is now him who is surrounded by

12445
07:41:27,200 --> 07:41:29,638
team spirit Heroes too many to count and

12446
07:41:29,638 --> 07:41:31,398
that is a mest chaos Knight coming in

12447
07:41:31,398 --> 07:41:33,040
and cleaning up the enemy carry there

12448
07:41:33,040 --> 07:41:35,160
youor gets some XP a much better

12449
07:41:35,160 --> 07:41:36,760
turnaround for him as opposed to the

12450
07:41:36,760 --> 07:41:38,040
last River fight where they're still

12451
07:41:38,040 --> 07:41:39,638
missing that tier one so maybe a smoke

12452
07:41:39,638 --> 07:41:41,958
and connection that Quinn in the gang

12453
07:41:41,958 --> 07:41:44,318
just didn't expect considering you know

12454
07:41:44,318 --> 07:41:45,558
they're missing that objective that went

12455
07:41:45,558 --> 07:41:49,240
down in the previous fight Tower attack

12456
07:41:49,240 --> 07:41:51,440
but it seems like team spirit take

12457
07:41:51,440 --> 07:41:53,760
advantage of that bit of an Overlook

12458
07:41:53,760 --> 07:41:57,680
from Quinn and now collapse highest net

12459
07:41:57,680 --> 07:42:00,000
worth in the game but game Gladiators

12460
07:42:00,000 --> 07:42:01,318
don't want to slow down just yet they

12461
07:42:01,318 --> 07:42:02,840
still have that Rolling Thunder didn't

12462
07:42:02,840 --> 07:42:04,840
use it in the last fight so tofu and

12463
07:42:04,840 --> 07:42:06,958
celery think to themselves that if they

12464
07:42:06,958 --> 07:42:08,440
can get the right kind of initiation

12465
07:42:08,440 --> 07:42:09,558
here with the Rolling Thunder they could

12466
07:42:09,558 --> 07:42:11,920
follow it up the ice blast but yoro

12467
07:42:11,920 --> 07:42:13,280
uh-oh he's in the staircase it's going

12468
07:42:13,280 --> 07:42:14,760
to be very awkward the soul bite does

12469
07:42:14,760 --> 07:42:16,120
actually latch onto the two of them as

12470
07:42:16,120 --> 07:42:18,120
Spector jumps into as well please tell

12471
07:42:18,120 --> 07:42:19,520
me they're going to hit him oh they

12472
07:42:19,520 --> 07:42:22,798
barely got it in the fountain he will go

12473
07:42:22,798 --> 07:42:25,080
down it wasn't even the blast it was

12474
07:42:25,080 --> 07:42:27,040
like an earn tick or something that got

12475
07:42:27,040 --> 07:42:29,878
him in the end host that grave

12476
07:42:29,878 --> 07:42:31,440
that was a nasty Soul bind something

12477
07:42:31,440 --> 07:42:32,080
they're going to have to think about

12478
07:42:32,080 --> 07:42:34,920
with Dau Haunting in they find theck Ace

12479
07:42:34,920 --> 07:42:36,760
is so close to his Radiance he could not

12480
07:42:36,760 --> 07:42:38,558
afford to get picked off here so at the

12481
07:42:38,558 --> 07:42:40,680
first side of danger he uses his Primal

12482
07:42:40,680 --> 07:42:42,120
split though you could see the spirit

12483
07:42:42,120 --> 07:42:43,558
Breakers pretty good answer to those

12484
07:42:43,558 --> 07:42:45,958
brings no threat of dying here something

12485
07:42:45,958 --> 07:42:47,718
to think about later into the game

12486
07:42:47,718 --> 07:42:49,160
normally the dispell and tornado is a

12487
07:42:49,160 --> 07:42:51,240
problem for this hero but doesn't look

12488
07:42:51,240 --> 07:42:52,360
like it so far and like you said

12489
07:42:52,360 --> 07:42:54,280
Radiance 300 off for Ace he just wants

12490
07:42:54,280 --> 07:42:56,080
to get his big item and get the farm

12491
07:42:56,080 --> 07:42:57,760
rate going still having a very good game

12492
07:42:57,760 --> 07:42:59,478
on this brew master yeah considering the

12493
07:42:59,478 --> 07:43:01,360
lone Droid game where he was so close to

12494
07:43:01,360 --> 07:43:03,040
the radiance for so long I don't think

12495
07:43:03,040 --> 07:43:04,478
he wants to risk that happening again

12496
07:43:04,478 --> 07:43:06,080
Radiance is an incredibly powerful item

12497
07:43:06,080 --> 07:43:08,200
in this meta it's better the faster you

12498
07:43:08,200 --> 07:43:09,760
get it in a lot of those games Ace just

12499
07:43:09,760 --> 07:43:11,000
didn't get it at a time where he could

12500
07:43:11,000 --> 07:43:12,638
take the map or the fight's over with it

12501
07:43:12,638 --> 07:43:13,600
this is going to be a game where he has

12502
07:43:13,600 --> 07:43:16,680
a very good chance to do that as yoro

12503
07:43:16,680 --> 07:43:19,240
still behind right this is a double mest

12504
07:43:19,240 --> 07:43:20,478
lineup for team spirit they have one on

12505
07:43:20,478 --> 07:43:22,520
the CK one on the spear breaker which

12506
07:43:22,520 --> 07:43:24,040
you know has become the deao build for

12507
07:43:24,040 --> 07:43:26,080
the XP getting to the late game Talent

12508
07:43:26,080 --> 07:43:27,558
is going to slow the team fight presence

12509
07:43:27,558 --> 07:43:29,360
down I really feel like if game can get

12510
07:43:29,360 --> 07:43:31,120
a fight going in the next two to 3

12511
07:43:31,120 --> 07:43:32,520
minutes here they're pretty favored

12512
07:43:32,520 --> 07:43:34,160
especially with diffusal and Radiance

12513
07:43:34,160 --> 07:43:35,478
coming out at the same time this is a

12514
07:43:35,478 --> 07:43:37,878
huge damage power Spike you want to get

12515
07:43:37,878 --> 07:43:39,000
something going with it and you want to

12516
07:43:39,000 --> 07:43:41,558
get it going now they go for it the

12517
07:43:41,558 --> 07:43:43,240
radiance is complete though on Ace but

12518
07:43:43,240 --> 07:43:45,240
they know the Primal split is on cool

12519
07:43:45,240 --> 07:43:47,200
down yeah this is a beefy Target to just

12520
07:43:47,200 --> 07:43:49,398
go into especially when you don't have

12521
07:43:49,398 --> 07:43:51,840
the global ability to connect how much

12522
07:43:51,840 --> 07:43:53,600
does collapse think he chunk through

12523
07:43:53,600 --> 07:43:56,718
here tofu just left him alone tofu was

12524
07:43:56,718 --> 07:43:58,160
needed to be able to disrupt this

12525
07:43:58,160 --> 07:44:00,878
combination but now Ace is left alone

12526
07:44:00,878 --> 07:44:02,318
speeds himself away somehow the ink

12527
07:44:02,318 --> 07:44:03,958
swell didn't go off in time but poka

12528
07:44:03,958 --> 07:44:06,120
didn't pop that one atashi was like okay

12529
07:44:06,120 --> 07:44:08,920
now it's my opportunity hello moska oh

12530
07:44:08,920 --> 07:44:10,280
almost got him with a fear shot there on

12531
07:44:10,280 --> 07:44:12,360
the left hand side but moska still dies

12532
07:44:12,360 --> 07:44:13,920
collapse still in trouble has a charge

12533
07:44:13,920 --> 07:44:15,920
instead Ops to the TPL up but that

12534
07:44:15,920 --> 07:44:19,000
doesn't make it calculations not on

12535
07:44:19,000 --> 07:44:20,318
point here yeah he could have just

12536
07:44:20,318 --> 07:44:21,600
charged the other side of the map maybe

12537
07:44:21,600 --> 07:44:23,240
he didn't have a good Target but there

12538
07:44:23,240 --> 07:44:26,040
was a midwave he will collect a 3xtra

12539
07:44:26,040 --> 07:44:27,680
this such an important kill too ging

12540
07:44:27,680 --> 07:44:30,000
Gladiators with the ice blast on top of

12541
07:44:30,000 --> 07:44:33,318
Laurel now collaps and Laurel who were

12542
07:44:33,318 --> 07:44:34,958
very much needed to be able to buy y

12543
07:44:34,958 --> 07:44:37,240
Toro time now they've both fallen and

12544
07:44:37,240 --> 07:44:38,958
now you're invading eny triangle this is

12545
07:44:38,958 --> 07:44:40,160
where gaming want to strike they want to

12546
07:44:40,160 --> 07:44:41,718
strike hard on the map right now gain a

12547
07:44:41,718 --> 07:44:43,520
lot of the momentum in this game they

12548
07:44:43,520 --> 07:44:45,120
have the supports to follow up on the

12549
07:44:45,120 --> 07:44:47,240
core initiations they have a crap ton of

12550
07:44:47,240 --> 07:44:48,840
damage in the tank as long as they can

12551
07:44:48,840 --> 07:44:51,958
see Heroes and with Dau able to join any

12552
07:44:51,958 --> 07:44:53,600
of these ghost suddenly this map has

12553
07:44:53,600 --> 07:44:55,878
collapsed pretty fast for team spirit

12554
07:44:55,878 --> 07:44:59,160
and a on the tazzle try and stem some is

12555
07:44:59,160 --> 07:45:01,958
bleeding but right now this crowd they

12556
07:45:01,958 --> 07:45:03,200
want to see a game forward they want to

12557
07:45:03,200 --> 07:45:05,600
see G and strike back in this game three

12558
07:45:05,600 --> 07:45:07,760
and they are delivering yeah I'm not

12559
07:45:07,760 --> 07:45:09,040
even convinced those are all gaming

12560
07:45:09,040 --> 07:45:10,920
Gladiators fans they might just be DOTA

12561
07:45:10,920 --> 07:45:12,638
fans who want to be able to see more

12562
07:45:12,638 --> 07:45:14,360
from a grand finals between these two

12563
07:45:14,360 --> 07:45:16,440
teams but it's still a long road ahead

12564
07:45:16,440 --> 07:45:18,558
for gaming Gladiators cuz they're only

12565
07:45:18,558 --> 07:45:20,840
2K net worth up they've hit some timings

12566
07:45:20,840 --> 07:45:22,798
yes but they still have to worry about

12567
07:45:22,798 --> 07:45:24,798
the double hand amas they have to play

12568
07:45:24,798 --> 07:45:26,360
this clean they need to be able to get

12569
07:45:26,360 --> 07:45:28,318
good executions but they can't afford to

12570
07:45:28,318 --> 07:45:30,318
use any kickoffs good roll in from Quinn

12571
07:45:30,318 --> 07:45:32,878
from behind though trapping team spirit

12572
07:45:32,878 --> 07:45:34,878
H shot goes out looking for more The

12573
07:45:34,878 --> 07:45:37,280
Dazzle was shown there Quinn getting in

12574
07:45:37,280 --> 07:45:38,718
front of him blocks him out with a swash

12575
07:45:38,718 --> 07:45:40,080
buckle slows him down with the inhibit

12576
07:45:40,080 --> 07:45:41,958
from the diffusive plate allows Daio to

12577
07:45:41,958 --> 07:45:43,840
do the damage he pops a shallow grave

12578
07:45:43,840 --> 07:45:46,240
lurl he really wants to off Quinn will

12579
07:45:46,240 --> 07:45:48,200
he get that kill the poison touch he's

12580
07:45:48,200 --> 07:45:50,478
got a regen a Lotus given over to him as

12581
07:45:50,478 --> 07:45:52,718
well good plays from gaming Gladiators

12582
07:45:52,718 --> 07:45:54,638
give him the extra bit of regen he needs

12583
07:45:54,638 --> 07:45:56,520
and now he can pop the Regeneration in

12584
07:45:56,520 --> 07:45:59,360
his bottle for a full heal Max I see

12585
07:45:59,360 --> 07:46:00,840
right now all team spe can do is cut

12586
07:46:00,840 --> 07:46:02,520
some waves with their double mest Heroes

12587
07:46:02,520 --> 07:46:05,280
and and go late cuz right now it is all

12588
07:46:05,280 --> 07:46:07,600
gaming on the momentum chart and a full

12589
07:46:07,600 --> 07:46:09,878
vessel was completed very fast here from

12590
07:46:09,878 --> 07:46:12,080
tofu that even gives you more damage

12591
07:46:12,080 --> 07:46:14,318
vessel plus a blast is nasty in these

12592
07:46:14,318 --> 07:46:15,240
team fights when you're throwing the

12593
07:46:15,240 --> 07:46:17,440
vortexes down particularly versus dazu

12594
07:46:17,440 --> 07:46:18,478
wants to just heal through with the

12595
07:46:18,478 --> 07:46:21,000
inverse waves and get that going yeah

12596
07:46:21,000 --> 07:46:23,040
you've got Dazzle You've Got The Inkwell

12597
07:46:23,040 --> 07:46:24,840
heal that you know would have been a

12598
07:46:24,840 --> 07:46:26,558
factor if it wasn't for the all the

12599
07:46:26,558 --> 07:46:28,398
anti- heal they have and then also the

12600
07:46:28,398 --> 07:46:30,478
chaos that life steal that the chaos

12601
07:46:30,478 --> 07:46:32,318
night is so dependent on and there is no

12602
07:46:32,318 --> 07:46:34,080
downtime for this lineup look at a

12603
07:46:34,080 --> 07:46:35,840
burned out of Mana they try and give him

12604
07:46:35,840 --> 07:46:37,478
over a little bit see if he can charge

12605
07:46:37,478 --> 07:46:38,760
his way out of there but he's silenced

12606
07:46:38,760 --> 07:46:40,360
up by The Calling trapped to the corner

12607
07:46:40,360 --> 07:46:42,080
and then they use that storm Panda to be

12608
07:46:42,080 --> 07:46:43,718
able to catch more Laurel is going to

12609
07:46:43,718 --> 07:46:45,840
die as well the Dazzle getting no

12610
07:46:45,840 --> 07:46:48,878
footing in this game Ace making his

12611
07:46:48,878 --> 07:46:50,718
presence felt and this was with a second

12612
07:46:50,718 --> 07:46:52,878
item boots a travel so this isn't even

12613
07:46:52,878 --> 07:46:53,878
some like

12614
07:46:53,878 --> 07:46:56,120
ear looks like he didn't have a way back

12615
07:46:56,120 --> 07:46:57,760
to the base so he tried to skirt on

12616
07:46:57,760 --> 07:47:00,160
through gaming gladi side of the map but

12617
07:47:00,160 --> 07:47:02,840
he was spotted and he will be brought

12618
07:47:02,840 --> 07:47:05,280
down this Pro Spector combination

12619
07:47:05,280 --> 07:47:08,318
working wonders right now is Ace is 5 Z

12620
07:47:08,318 --> 07:47:12,080
and 10 completely Unstoppable and you

12621
07:47:12,080 --> 07:47:13,878
can't bring the CK in to really help you

12622
07:47:13,878 --> 07:47:15,398
here the Brew is just great versus the

12623
07:47:15,398 --> 07:47:17,638
hero with the radiance burn the AOE Miss

12624
07:47:17,638 --> 07:47:19,600
he has the evasion that yoro can't

12625
07:47:19,600 --> 07:47:21,760
Pierce and not to mention his old you go

12626
07:47:21,760 --> 07:47:24,600
in start messing up the CK Illusions

12627
07:47:24,600 --> 07:47:26,920
yeah with Radiance and the dispel chaos

12628
07:47:26,920 --> 07:47:29,200
Knight's going to be so what are your I

12629
07:47:29,200 --> 07:47:30,398
mean you have to just wait until your

12630
07:47:30,398 --> 07:47:32,080
t's ready to fight I think you have to

12631
07:47:32,080 --> 07:47:33,558
split the map with the breaker and this

12632
07:47:33,558 --> 07:47:34,920
is where gaming can continue to try and

12633
07:47:34,920 --> 07:47:36,638
pick you off put the vessel to use put

12634
07:47:36,638 --> 07:47:39,958
the radiance to use and of course Daio

12635
07:47:39,958 --> 07:47:41,760
he's on a hero that doesn't have to you

12636
07:47:41,760 --> 07:47:43,520
know Farm up some crazy Stacks doesn't

12637
07:47:43,520 --> 07:47:45,000
have to go in the fight first he can

12638
07:47:45,000 --> 07:47:46,958
just Farm the defensive parts of the map

12639
07:47:46,958 --> 07:47:48,398
if nothing happens he's still happy I

12640
07:47:48,398 --> 07:47:51,080
mean you still got a

12641
07:47:52,958 --> 07:47:55,680
spectre drum for tofu just to buff up

12642
07:47:55,680 --> 07:47:58,920
the team fight even more here

12643
07:47:58,920 --> 07:48:01,478
SMA is doing work also having a perfect

12644
07:48:01,478 --> 07:48:04,240
game so far and the calling is not a

12645
07:48:04,240 --> 07:48:05,680
spell that these team spirit Heroes want

12646
07:48:05,680 --> 07:48:07,200
to fight into it's it's annoying for

12647
07:48:07,200 --> 07:48:08,840
Mira going in with the snowball it's

12648
07:48:08,840 --> 07:48:10,680
annoying for Laurel trying to run in gra

12649
07:48:10,680 --> 07:48:13,520
people with lowl

12650
07:48:13,958 --> 07:48:16,798
grave team fight is very obnoxious right

12651
07:48:16,798 --> 07:48:17,878
now and it's going to collect a free

12652
07:48:17,878 --> 07:48:18,840
tier

12653
07:48:18,840 --> 07:48:21,680
two so a tier two at 19 minutes for

12654
07:48:21,680 --> 07:48:22,600
gameing

12655
07:48:22,600 --> 07:48:25,040
gladiators they can actually take away

12656
07:48:25,040 --> 07:48:27,240
that Outpost they've got a pretty good

12657
07:48:27,240 --> 07:48:29,240
choke hold on the map

12658
07:48:29,240 --> 07:48:31,718
SC they desperately need now is just not

12659
07:48:31,718 --> 07:48:33,718
to slip up anywhere not allow team

12660
07:48:33,718 --> 07:48:35,798
spirit in opening they're building up

12661
07:48:35,798 --> 07:48:37,798
this net worth lead and may become

12662
07:48:37,798 --> 07:48:40,240
insurmountable as long as team spirit

12663
07:48:40,240 --> 07:48:42,440
doesn't pull anything sneaky here the

12664
07:48:42,440 --> 07:48:46,878
smoke up it slips right past team spirit

12665
07:48:46,878 --> 07:48:49,440
immediately SP moska and Dau recognizes

12666
07:48:49,440 --> 07:48:50,798
that that is the hero he wants to get

12667
07:48:50,798 --> 07:48:52,398
first and the Deadshot bounced over to

12668
07:48:52,398 --> 07:48:54,638
yoro and hit by the Rolling Thunder he's

12669
07:48:54,638 --> 07:48:57,040
trapped caught and there's nowhere to go

12670
07:48:57,040 --> 07:48:59,318
from there too many to save cbles on the

12671
07:48:59,318 --> 07:49:01,840
side of gaming Gladiators and they have

12672
07:49:01,840 --> 07:49:05,040
way too much damage they need the bkbs

12673
07:49:05,040 --> 07:49:06,558
on the side of team spirit but they're

12674
07:49:06,558 --> 07:49:08,398
not going to get them anytime soon he

12675
07:49:08,398 --> 07:49:10,440
had it oh he had it yeah was a bkb he

12676
07:49:10,440 --> 07:49:11,638
disassembled and body he just didn't

12677
07:49:11,638 --> 07:49:13,280
want to pop it he didn't have fantasm

12678
07:49:13,280 --> 07:49:15,040
there's no turnaround there yeah he will

12679
07:49:15,040 --> 07:49:17,478
choose to save it for another day that

12680
07:49:17,478 --> 07:49:19,840
is the fifth death for yoro here who is

12681
07:49:19,840 --> 07:49:22,360
yet to make a single kill in this game

12682
07:49:22,360 --> 07:49:24,600
hey there's The Dazzle play though 20

12683
07:49:24,600 --> 07:49:25,718
minutes on the dot they're going to use

12684
07:49:25,718 --> 07:49:29,000
the couriers to uh use the agony sh a

12685
07:49:29,000 --> 07:49:32,958
wave he could solo up that that's the

12686
07:49:32,958 --> 07:49:34,160
better Shard I think they were hoping

12687
07:49:34,160 --> 07:49:36,240
for oh yeah ink swell Shard for moska

12688
07:49:36,240 --> 07:49:38,440
going to be pretty damn nice here trying

12689
07:49:38,440 --> 07:49:39,840
dispel these melee Heroes when they go

12690
07:49:39,840 --> 07:49:41,520
in Tower still I feel like if you're

12691
07:49:41,520 --> 07:49:42,840
team spirit you're trying to rat this

12692
07:49:42,840 --> 07:49:44,520
game out right now and that is a big

12693
07:49:44,520 --> 07:49:46,240
Paradigm ship from games one and two

12694
07:49:46,240 --> 07:49:47,680
yeah how do you RP though against a

12695
07:49:47,680 --> 07:49:50,878
spectre and well you got this

12696
07:49:50,878 --> 07:49:53,680
Quinn he is running around with a banger

12697
07:49:53,680 --> 07:49:55,398
you're not going to be able to Solo in a

12698
07:49:55,398 --> 07:49:58,080
lane for very long it only takes a few

12699
07:49:58,080 --> 07:50:00,080
seconds for ging Gladiators to spot the

12700
07:50:00,080 --> 07:50:01,478
opportunity and jump onto you an ice

12701
07:50:01,478 --> 07:50:03,360
blast not even needed tofu has the

12702
07:50:03,360 --> 07:50:06,240
damage necessary to kill the support by

12703
07:50:06,240 --> 07:50:08,398
himself and the really nice thing about

12704
07:50:08,398 --> 07:50:10,240
what's happening right now for gaming is

12705
07:50:10,240 --> 07:50:11,760
this Spectre is doing an amazing job

12706
07:50:11,760 --> 07:50:12,958
protecting their Wards one of the

12707
07:50:12,958 --> 07:50:14,080
biggest things you have to combat when

12708
07:50:14,080 --> 07:50:15,240
you play against team spirit is the

12709
07:50:15,240 --> 07:50:17,040
vision Advantage they had it a lot in

12710
07:50:17,040 --> 07:50:18,680
game one with that tream protector they

12711
07:50:18,680 --> 07:50:20,558
abused it pretty damn well in game two

12712
07:50:20,558 --> 07:50:23,160
here it's moska trying to get out get

12713
07:50:23,160 --> 07:50:25,398
vision for the team deward these

12714
07:50:25,398 --> 07:50:26,840
aggressive OBS that are doing work for

12715
07:50:26,840 --> 07:50:27,878
gaming because they know they're there

12716
07:50:27,878 --> 07:50:29,680
they're getting haunted on the cool

12717
07:50:29,680 --> 07:50:30,878
Downs just so damn Low by the time

12718
07:50:30,878 --> 07:50:32,840
you're back up by the time you run there

12719
07:50:32,840 --> 07:50:34,760
to try and gain anything they're ready

12720
07:50:34,760 --> 07:50:37,240
to jump on you again and uh yeah I mean

12721
07:50:37,240 --> 07:50:39,000
there's always a little Spectre bias in

12722
07:50:39,000 --> 07:50:40,520
the win probability I think that's fair

12723
07:50:40,520 --> 07:50:42,558
to say but this is this is the best

12724
07:50:42,558 --> 07:50:44,920
gameing has looked in this series by a

12725
07:50:44,920 --> 07:50:47,000
large degree they're continuing to build

12726
07:50:47,000 --> 07:50:48,600
the momentum and he can continue to

12727
07:50:48,600 --> 07:50:50,718
build the single Target items since Ace

12728
07:50:50,718 --> 07:50:53,240
is building the or built the radiance so

12729
07:50:53,240 --> 07:50:55,080
he could just focus on being able to

12730
07:50:55,080 --> 07:50:56,760
take out a support in a second he's

12731
07:50:56,760 --> 07:50:59,240
going to build into an orchid up next so

12732
07:50:59,240 --> 07:51:01,200
now if you're spotted anywhere on the

12733
07:51:01,200 --> 07:51:04,840
map Daio can guarantee that the Grim

12734
07:51:04,840 --> 07:51:07,200
shoke dies or the tus dies or maybe even

12735
07:51:07,200 --> 07:51:09,600
some of the cores he's going to pop it

12736
07:51:09,600 --> 07:51:12,798
here looking for mea they just get the

12737
07:51:12,798 --> 07:51:14,840
vision on him they'll spot him now and

12738
07:51:14,840 --> 07:51:16,040
there it is they jump immediately

12739
07:51:16,040 --> 07:51:18,120
snowball tried to put to work but it

12740
07:51:18,120 --> 07:51:19,478
just means he going to be dragged back

12741
07:51:19,478 --> 07:51:20,840
in does manage to get a Shard but

12742
07:51:20,840 --> 07:51:22,680
unfortunately Daio doesn't care about

12743
07:51:22,680 --> 07:51:24,440
your blocks there the GU shards does

12744
07:51:24,440 --> 07:51:27,958
nothing when he has free pathing spirit

12745
07:51:27,958 --> 07:51:30,000
just Bleeding Out right now they have no

12746
07:51:30,000 --> 07:51:32,160
answer to the Spectre on the map their

12747
07:51:32,160 --> 07:51:33,718
supports are way too squishy they don't

12748
07:51:33,718 --> 07:51:35,360
have an early Aura bu there's no Beast

12749
07:51:35,360 --> 07:51:37,160
Master or anything to to help protect

12750
07:51:37,160 --> 07:51:38,718
the backline on the map or help them get

12751
07:51:38,718 --> 07:51:40,558
Lanes out all three of these cores are

12752
07:51:40,558 --> 07:51:42,000
just building for themselves right it's

12753
07:51:42,000 --> 07:51:44,638
damage items into bkb you have two mides

12754
07:51:44,638 --> 07:51:46,160
that are still trying to get the work

12755
07:51:46,160 --> 07:51:48,718
done kaps will try and find a Pick Off

12756
07:51:48,718 --> 07:51:50,760
on tofu and this will combine with moska

12757
07:51:50,760 --> 07:51:51,958
so they strike back a little bit on the

12758
07:51:51,958 --> 07:51:53,958
map much needed and finally they're

12759
07:51:53,958 --> 07:51:55,520
getting some deep Vision out as well you

12760
07:51:55,520 --> 07:51:57,440
look at these dire OBS it took MOS a

12761
07:51:57,440 --> 07:51:59,440
while but these are some Vision they can

12762
07:51:59,440 --> 07:52:01,638
play around at least though of course

12763
07:52:01,638 --> 07:52:03,360
the second you get

12764
07:52:03,360 --> 07:52:06,478
spotted it's moska somehow doesn't get

12765
07:52:06,478 --> 07:52:08,318
spotted by Quinn there and they have to

12766
07:52:08,318 --> 07:52:09,798
charge back in are they really going to

12767
07:52:09,798 --> 07:52:11,000
try this the second time he's got an

12768
07:52:11,000 --> 07:52:14,318
armor Rune H so much Shields he's got

12769
07:52:14,318 --> 07:52:16,440
the poha is just going to stay hidden

12770
07:52:16,440 --> 07:52:19,680
here the charge canceled by the spirit

12771
07:52:19,680 --> 07:52:23,080
breaker ring Thunder very far away he's

12772
07:52:23,080 --> 07:52:25,440
just going to initiate from 3,000 yeah

12773
07:52:25,440 --> 07:52:26,840
because at any point in time the Spectre

12774
07:52:26,840 --> 07:52:28,040
can join him as soon as he gets that

12775
07:52:28,040 --> 07:52:29,680
initiate but they don't catch him the

12776
07:52:29,680 --> 07:52:32,200
ice blast going to be stretched outo see

12777
07:52:32,200 --> 07:52:34,558
opport this yeah he's going to go foro

12778
07:52:34,558 --> 07:52:37,120
GE with the there's so many Heroes they

12779
07:52:37,120 --> 07:52:38,920
dis pull out the fantasm but yoro

12780
07:52:38,920 --> 07:52:40,920
himself he will bring down he will use

12781
07:52:40,920 --> 07:52:42,680
his own hand to take down the enemy

12782
07:52:42,680 --> 07:52:44,318
carry now looks to finish up these

12783
07:52:44,318 --> 07:52:47,120
brings if possible gam and Gladiator

12784
07:52:47,120 --> 07:52:49,040
trying so hard the last one is going to

12785
07:52:49,040 --> 07:52:50,878
die double kill for utoro and they turn

12786
07:52:50,878 --> 07:52:53,478
back for celery a blink away from Quinn

12787
07:52:53,478 --> 07:52:55,080
he cannot afford to get caught here but

12788
07:52:55,080 --> 07:52:57,920
he doesn't have a TP if he gets spotted

12789
07:52:57,920 --> 07:53:01,000
they scanned him they know of the scan

12790
07:53:01,000 --> 07:53:03,280
uhoh Quinn's going to be in for a rude

12791
07:53:03,280 --> 07:53:05,160
awakening in a second here he just needs

12792
07:53:05,160 --> 07:53:06,760
his blink up and he gets by the D Jo

12793
07:53:06,760 --> 07:53:08,000
swash will from the side but they have

12794
07:53:08,000 --> 07:53:10,120
the silence on him the ghost remains

12795
07:53:10,120 --> 07:53:11,878
with Quinn he tries to go for a roll of

12796
07:53:11,878 --> 07:53:14,478
play but he's got nowhere to roll away

12797
07:53:14,478 --> 07:53:16,520
two those have TP back but stuck in the

12798
07:53:16,520 --> 07:53:18,680
corner get some good damage from Buckle

12799
07:53:18,680 --> 07:53:21,120
too many Heroes really nice scan to

12800
07:53:21,120 --> 07:53:23,558
finish up that fight and I mean a little

12801
07:53:23,558 --> 07:53:25,200
overextension there under a tier two

12802
07:53:25,200 --> 07:53:27,478
gives a really good fight to yoro Ace

12803
07:53:27,478 --> 07:53:28,680
dispelled a lot of the illusion

12804
07:53:28,680 --> 07:53:30,638
instantly dealt with some of the DPS but

12805
07:53:30,638 --> 07:53:32,360
inkwells the shards all these little

12806
07:53:32,360 --> 07:53:34,440
spells adding up and of course Dao going

12807
07:53:34,440 --> 07:53:36,200
down first that's a lot of the damage

12808
07:53:36,200 --> 07:53:37,600
that's been working for you downside of

12809
07:53:37,600 --> 07:53:39,360
this Orchid build right the pickoff game

12810
07:53:39,360 --> 07:53:41,120
is where it's strong the five on five

12811
07:53:41,120 --> 07:53:42,440
this Orchid is not doing anything for

12812
07:53:42,440 --> 07:53:44,878
you into the early bkbs here team spirit

12813
07:53:44,878 --> 07:53:47,040
strike back and just like that somehow

12814
07:53:47,040 --> 07:53:49,760
yoro is top of the board with from 05 to

12815
07:53:49,760 --> 07:53:51,200
tus net worth this Midas and the

12816
07:53:51,200 --> 07:53:52,878
Illusions are doing work on the map

12817
07:53:52,878 --> 07:53:55,440
right now and remember this was double

12818
07:53:55,440 --> 07:53:58,638
minus lineup plus A Dazzle the the the h

12819
07:53:58,638 --> 07:54:00,958
Tinker this lineup is going to start

12820
07:54:00,958 --> 07:54:02,718
ramping up pretty damn quickly if you

12821
07:54:02,718 --> 07:54:04,200
give them the space to work with and

12822
07:54:04,200 --> 07:54:05,440
right now they've got three cores

12823
07:54:05,440 --> 07:54:06,840
farming in three different parts of the

12824
07:54:06,840 --> 07:54:09,000
map after a successful team fight

12825
07:54:09,000 --> 07:54:11,760
gameing Gladiators they cannot afford

12826
07:54:11,760 --> 07:54:14,000
any more slip UPS they've got Roshan

12827
07:54:14,000 --> 07:54:16,958
still be taken here at 25 minutes in

12828
07:54:16,958 --> 07:54:19,240
it's also time for moska to deward one

12829
07:54:19,240 --> 07:54:20,520
of the problems they were facing earlier

12830
07:54:20,520 --> 07:54:21,680
in this game suddenly he can run around

12831
07:54:21,680 --> 07:54:23,120
with his Courier place a bunch of

12832
07:54:23,120 --> 07:54:24,798
centuries make sure there's not the Deep

12833
07:54:24,798 --> 07:54:26,360
Vision that gaming were playing off of

12834
07:54:26,360 --> 07:54:28,718
earlier so now it shifts the onus back

12835
07:54:28,718 --> 07:54:30,240
on to G in terms of you got to make an

12836
07:54:30,240 --> 07:54:31,680
aggressive smoke get Vision back on the

12837
07:54:31,680 --> 07:54:33,440
map and keep setting up these pickoff

12838
07:54:33,440 --> 07:54:35,638
plays for Daio who's the one may getting

12839
07:54:35,638 --> 07:54:38,360
picked off here to just walks in blind

12840
07:54:38,360 --> 07:54:40,558
get pull him back in but the silence is

12841
07:54:40,558 --> 07:54:42,240
doing a lot of work Quinn tries to R up

12842
07:54:42,240 --> 07:54:44,478
but collaps off the ice blast do man

12843
07:54:44,478 --> 07:54:46,920
grab two of those cores roll up snowball

12844
07:54:46,920 --> 07:54:48,120
onto

12845
07:54:48,120 --> 07:54:50,200
D's in Big Time trouble they give him

12846
07:54:50,200 --> 07:54:51,120
the shallow

12847
07:54:51,120 --> 07:54:53,718
gra bkb but if be will SHP plock it on

12848
07:54:53,718 --> 07:54:55,478
some of these Heroes is not enough T

12849
07:54:55,478 --> 07:54:57,120
still Falls and now with a toss up in

12850
07:54:57,120 --> 07:54:58,920
the air L will come down to a hard

12851
07:54:58,920 --> 07:55:01,318
reality crash down he does have the bkb

12852
07:55:01,318 --> 07:55:03,920
and look that agon inceptor with so many

12853
07:55:03,920 --> 07:55:06,878
units around him it's no hotal he is not

12854
07:55:06,878 --> 07:55:09,040
going to die so easily gaming Gladiators

12855
07:55:09,040 --> 07:55:10,840
thought they had an easy target fight to

12856
07:55:10,840 --> 07:55:13,280
the bend he bring down toio before he

12857
07:55:13,280 --> 07:55:15,398
finally Falls collapse stuck though in

12858
07:55:15,398 --> 07:55:18,000
the silence the buyback required from

12859
07:55:18,000 --> 07:55:21,000
gaming Gladiators because Laurel was too

12860
07:55:21,000 --> 07:55:23,200
t of a nut to

12861
07:55:23,200 --> 07:55:25,718
crack that looked way closer than it

12862
07:55:25,718 --> 07:55:27,718
should have been right these inverse

12863
07:55:27,718 --> 07:55:29,520
heals are doing Mad work at the end of

12864
07:55:29,520 --> 07:55:31,718
the fight have to respect the burst that

12865
07:55:31,718 --> 07:55:32,920
come out from this Dazzle when that a

12866
07:55:32,920 --> 07:55:34,920
blast has been used earlier on but still

12867
07:55:34,920 --> 07:55:37,160
great keep fight from G started out with

12868
07:55:37,160 --> 07:55:38,958
the atoro just walking blind into their

12869
07:55:38,958 --> 07:55:40,638
triangle and they were ready for him

12870
07:55:40,638 --> 07:55:42,398
Shadow Blade did not help him out in

12871
07:55:42,398 --> 07:55:44,520
that type of fight and that ice blast it

12872
07:55:44,520 --> 07:55:46,080
was a beauty from celery landed on

12873
07:55:46,080 --> 07:55:47,360
pretty much everybody forces the

12874
07:55:47,360 --> 07:55:49,200
disengage and the calling silenced

12875
07:55:49,200 --> 07:55:51,478
mirror on this jump right this is the

12876
07:55:51,478 --> 07:55:53,680
problematic aspect of this support match

12877
07:55:53,680 --> 07:55:55,040
up when you go in with the tusar this

12878
07:55:55,040 --> 07:55:56,798
AOE silence Clips you your team fight's

12879
07:55:56,798 --> 07:55:58,878
just a nightmare beautiful shards on the

12880
07:55:58,878 --> 07:56:01,280
flip to block off the pandas from clal

12881
07:56:01,280 --> 07:56:03,798
another really heads up play but damn

12882
07:56:03,798 --> 07:56:05,160
the damage is already done at this point

12883
07:56:05,160 --> 07:56:06,398
and now it's just a matter of cleaning

12884
07:56:06,398 --> 07:56:09,000
up which sounds easier than it actually

12885
07:56:09,000 --> 07:56:11,240
looked like right all of those utions

12886
07:56:11,240 --> 07:56:13,600
and brings play against game in

12887
07:56:13,600 --> 07:56:15,760
Gladiator the worst way and in the end

12888
07:56:15,760 --> 07:56:18,680
laa living does get Daio killed so have

12889
07:56:18,680 --> 07:56:20,680
to think about clumping up on top of

12890
07:56:20,680 --> 07:56:22,040
this Dazzle in the later portions of

12891
07:56:22,040 --> 07:56:23,760
these fights but I mean luckily that's

12892
07:56:23,760 --> 07:56:25,398
all the Primal split right the second

12893
07:56:25,398 --> 07:56:26,798
Ace comes out he's still full he's still

12894
07:56:26,798 --> 07:56:29,000
got Mana Radiance he's ready to par

12895
07:56:29,000 --> 07:56:30,520
he's going to slap some extra kills down

12896
07:56:30,520 --> 07:56:32,440
for the full team wipe here just when

12897
07:56:32,440 --> 07:56:33,600
this game was slipping up a little bit

12898
07:56:33,600 --> 07:56:35,398
of momentum game and Strike Back get

12899
07:56:35,398 --> 07:56:36,878
themselves a full F man wipe into the

12900
07:56:36,878 --> 07:56:39,600
rosan we put an AIS out on Quinn here

12901
07:56:39,600 --> 07:56:42,398
who's slowly getting towards that a that

12902
07:56:42,398 --> 07:56:44,200
team fight definitely helps still 500

12903
07:56:44,200 --> 07:56:45,398
off here but that's going to be a large

12904
07:56:45,398 --> 07:56:48,160
damage ramp as the shadow step comes out

12905
07:56:48,160 --> 07:56:50,798
look trying to do this solo it's a bit

12906
07:56:50,798 --> 07:56:52,318
dangerous collapse they're going to try

12907
07:56:52,318 --> 07:56:53,360
and turn back around they do have the

12908
07:56:53,360 --> 07:56:54,760
ice blat that'll finish off here pretty

12909
07:56:54,760 --> 07:56:55,798
easily and collaps he's got to be

12910
07:56:55,798 --> 07:56:58,200
careful this damage by yoro he comes in

12911
07:56:58,200 --> 07:56:59,958
wies down Daio but the rest of the team

12912
07:56:59,958 --> 07:57:01,360
is now here from gaming Gladiators

12913
07:57:01,360 --> 07:57:02,600
looking for the catch but collaps

12914
07:57:02,600 --> 07:57:04,760
already rolled away ball taking out oh

12915
07:57:04,760 --> 07:57:06,600
the H shot it's not quite enough they

12916
07:57:06,600 --> 07:57:09,520
have no stuns collapse breaks

12917
07:57:09,520 --> 07:57:12,318
free straight through the man's heart he

12918
07:57:12,318 --> 07:57:14,760
did not care he just walks it off can't

12919
07:57:14,760 --> 07:57:17,080
really get much closer than that and

12920
07:57:17,080 --> 07:57:19,080
once more yoro he finds an angle in the

12921
07:57:19,080 --> 07:57:20,558
fight cleans up the rcho and gets the

12922
07:57:20,558 --> 07:57:22,558
hell out that is a full silver Edge

12923
07:57:22,558 --> 07:57:25,080
reveal done and now the AIS is going to

12924
07:57:25,080 --> 07:57:27,798
be taken away from Quinn ah the pickoff

12925
07:57:27,798 --> 07:57:29,958
game is shifting right yes it is they're

12926
07:57:29,958 --> 07:57:31,398
not respecting the shadow blades not

12927
07:57:31,398 --> 07:57:32,920
respecting the aggression but ulp are

12928
07:57:32,920 --> 07:57:35,520
stalls him up collaps utoro actually has

12929
07:57:35,520 --> 07:57:38,240
bkb they do catch the uh ancient

12930
07:57:38,240 --> 07:57:39,520
operation he's going to die pretty damn

12931
07:57:39,520 --> 07:57:41,200
quickly there roll up the brings going

12932
07:57:41,200 --> 07:57:43,840
to work though stalling out yoro now

12933
07:57:43,840 --> 07:57:46,200
that it's bkb is on cool down now their

12934
07:57:46,200 --> 07:57:47,638
magic damage can really go to work and

12935
07:57:47,638 --> 07:57:48,958
they can slice and dice through that

12936
07:57:48,958 --> 07:57:51,638
carry pretty damn quickly butka

12937
07:57:51,638 --> 07:57:53,478
obviously he doesn't have much hope of

12938
07:57:53,478 --> 07:57:55,840
living through this so the fight does

12939
07:57:55,840 --> 07:57:58,280
turn against them not the worst though

12940
07:57:58,280 --> 07:58:00,000
for for team spirit I would say just

12941
07:58:00,000 --> 07:58:01,958
purely the fact that they're continuing

12942
07:58:01,958 --> 07:58:04,318
to keep things a little even and their

12943
07:58:04,318 --> 07:58:06,160
other two cores are farming the map yes

12944
07:58:06,160 --> 07:58:07,398
and they've got to be happy with like

12945
07:58:07,398 --> 07:58:08,680
you know the next 10 minutes here this

12946
07:58:08,680 --> 07:58:09,920
is when The Dazzle and the breaker are

12947
07:58:09,920 --> 07:58:11,680
going to come online they've recovered

12948
07:58:11,680 --> 07:58:13,240
some of the Lost net worth differential

12949
07:58:13,240 --> 07:58:15,000
here these heres getting very spooky

12950
07:58:15,000 --> 07:58:16,520
around the third to Fourth item and

12951
07:58:16,520 --> 07:58:17,958
they're going to get them damn fast as

12952
07:58:17,958 --> 07:58:20,000
collapse is just farming up the map but

12953
07:58:20,000 --> 07:58:21,958
yur's aggression used against them here

12954
07:58:21,958 --> 07:58:24,000
they'll got the return carry kill that

12955
07:58:24,000 --> 07:58:25,840
was a cocky move going up that hill and

12956
07:58:25,840 --> 07:58:27,760
just taking the fight with his bkb he he

12957
07:58:27,760 --> 07:58:31,398
can bkb TV there just opted Blood for

12958
07:58:31,398 --> 07:58:33,920
Blood why not we're in the

12959
07:58:33,920 --> 07:58:37,318
arena I love that Daio still not slowing

12960
07:58:37,318 --> 07:58:38,920
down he may die every once in a while

12961
07:58:38,920 --> 07:58:40,478
but he says you know ultimately the end

12962
07:58:40,478 --> 07:58:42,360
game is okay with me we're still getting

12963
07:58:42,360 --> 07:58:44,398
some good trade-offs and fights I'm

12964
07:58:44,398 --> 07:58:46,200
still going to try and limit your split

12965
07:58:46,200 --> 07:58:48,200
Push by whereever he can doesn't want to

12966
07:58:48,200 --> 07:58:50,318
let it get away with a tier two for

12967
07:58:50,318 --> 07:58:52,398
free they stick on top of with the

12968
07:58:52,398 --> 07:58:54,240
silence and the stuns it's enough Quinn

12969
07:58:54,240 --> 07:58:57,000
is stunned up for so long and now tofu

12970
07:58:57,000 --> 07:58:58,200
is going to be in some trouble as well

12971
07:58:58,200 --> 07:58:59,760
pops his ultimate that just kind of

12972
07:58:59,760 --> 07:59:01,718
delays things a little bit but there's

12973
07:59:01,718 --> 07:59:04,160
no one coming to save him if you're

12974
07:59:04,160 --> 07:59:05,600
getting multiple ink SWS off in these

12975
07:59:05,600 --> 07:59:06,958
fights it's probably going to win you

12976
07:59:06,958 --> 07:59:08,200
the engagement and right now you're just

12977
07:59:08,200 --> 07:59:09,360
getting outnumbered at a tier two you

12978
07:59:09,360 --> 07:59:11,878
overextended on Courier will die as well

12979
07:59:11,878 --> 07:59:14,398
no brew master ultimate for that type of

12980
07:59:14,398 --> 07:59:16,440
fight as strong as Ace is right now with

12981
07:59:16,440 --> 07:59:18,798
a full AC completed on top of everything

12982
07:59:18,798 --> 07:59:20,718
else he does want this ult to take the

12983
07:59:20,718 --> 07:59:22,160
long engagement right he is the most

12984
07:59:22,160 --> 07:59:24,120
farmed hero in this game right now if

12985
07:59:24,120 --> 07:59:25,600
you're gameing you have to play around

12986
07:59:25,600 --> 07:59:26,958
what he wants to do where he wants to

12987
07:59:26,958 --> 07:59:28,440
take the fights and what he can commit

12988
07:59:28,440 --> 07:59:30,000
to otherwise you're just creating an

12989
07:59:30,000 --> 07:59:31,398
opening for Spirit to come in and pick

12990
07:59:31,398 --> 07:59:33,840
you off the too once more looking for

12991
07:59:33,840 --> 07:59:35,680
the initiation with two Heroes dead you

12992
07:59:35,680 --> 07:59:38,478
will get scouted on an OB Sentry this is

12993
07:59:38,478 --> 07:59:39,958
something that started to happen in that

12994
07:59:39,958 --> 07:59:42,360
game too where they managed to get like

12995
07:59:42,360 --> 07:59:44,398
it was that one pickoff on celery right

12996
07:59:44,398 --> 07:59:45,200
where it's like they used the

12997
07:59:45,200 --> 07:59:46,638
chronosphere picked off celery and it

12998
07:59:46,638 --> 07:59:49,040
was like okay Chrono for a five position

12999
07:59:49,040 --> 07:59:50,440
but then they kept that going you're

13000
07:59:50,440 --> 07:59:52,160
like okay it's four versus five then

13001
07:59:52,160 --> 07:59:53,638
they found another pickoff and another

13002
07:59:53,638 --> 07:59:55,160
pickoff and it just so quickly

13003
07:59:55,160 --> 07:59:57,160
snowballed against them gaming

13004
07:59:57,160 --> 08:00:00,318
Gladiators got beware team spirit will

13005
08:00:00,318 --> 08:00:02,280
keep this aggression on point if they

13006
08:00:02,280 --> 08:00:03,558
think they have the advantage and

13007
08:00:03,558 --> 08:00:06,040
another Tormentor swiftly dealt with

13008
08:00:06,040 --> 08:00:07,958
from laurl and the The Courier Brothers

13009
08:00:07,958 --> 08:00:09,280
over

13010
08:00:09,280 --> 08:00:12,478
here that'll just being his chaos bolt

13011
08:00:12,478 --> 08:00:14,478
is all the more deadly for some of these

13012
08:00:14,478 --> 08:00:16,478
supports and we can see how yoro wants

13013
08:00:16,478 --> 08:00:17,840
to take these fights right create

13014
08:00:17,840 --> 08:00:19,398
confusion with with his Al going through

13015
08:00:19,398 --> 08:00:21,120
on Lanes show up with the silver Edge

13016
08:00:21,120 --> 08:00:22,878
get a pickoff maybe reset he doesn't

13017
08:00:22,878 --> 08:00:24,318
have to commit into the full five on

13018
08:00:24,318 --> 08:00:26,318
five into the brew and Pango which can

13019
08:00:26,318 --> 08:00:28,520
control him in that type of situation oh

13020
08:00:28,520 --> 08:00:31,318
he got stck oh

13021
08:00:31,318 --> 08:00:35,680
no landed on a pebble there and as a

13022
08:00:35,680 --> 08:00:38,958
result moska gets a pretty free TP on

13023
08:00:38,958 --> 08:00:39,920
out of

13024
08:00:39,920 --> 08:00:42,160
there a smoke that's ruined a rolling

13025
08:00:42,160 --> 08:00:45,000
thunder that's used for

13026
08:00:45,000 --> 08:00:47,160
nothing interesting little

13027
08:00:47,160 --> 08:00:49,398
tree tree is just

13028
08:00:49,398 --> 08:00:51,638
powerful one of the Primal forces in

13029
08:00:51,638 --> 08:00:54,360
Dota first Cliffs then trees Quinn's

13030
08:00:54,360 --> 08:00:56,040
having a yeah qu's Quinn's having a

13031
08:00:56,040 --> 08:00:57,318
tough time with the ter he's fighting

13032
08:00:57,318 --> 08:00:59,760
team spirit he's fighting the the map

13033
08:00:59,760 --> 08:01:02,958
yeah happens to the best of us another

13034
08:01:02,958 --> 08:01:04,600
pickoff that they will miss which is

13035
08:01:04,600 --> 08:01:06,520
time for the Midas to go to work right

13036
08:01:06,520 --> 08:01:07,760
they have been cranking this whole time

13037
08:01:07,760 --> 08:01:09,398
and climbing the charts this game is a

13038
08:01:09,398 --> 08:01:12,558
1K net worth lead now at 32 minutes dead

13039
08:01:12,558 --> 08:01:14,718
even everything depends on these team

13040
08:01:14,718 --> 08:01:16,920
fights collapse just Char right kind of

13041
08:01:16,920 --> 08:01:20,520
initiation here a charge that hit

13042
08:01:20,520 --> 08:01:23,440
supports Quinn on the run here they be

13043
08:01:23,440 --> 08:01:25,520
to jump after him laurl chasing after

13044
08:01:25,520 --> 08:01:26,840
him with that Shard to be able to slow

13045
08:01:26,840 --> 08:01:28,398
him down yeah

13046
08:01:28,398 --> 08:01:30,440
he's not going anywhere three dead on

13047
08:01:30,440 --> 08:01:32,200
the side of gaming Gladiators and team

13048
08:01:32,200 --> 08:01:34,040
spirit have changed this game The

13049
08:01:34,040 --> 08:01:35,478
Narrative was supposed to be gaming

13050
08:01:35,478 --> 08:01:37,318
Gladiators controlling and seeing if

13051
08:01:37,318 --> 08:01:39,398
they can end it but team spirit have

13052
08:01:39,398 --> 08:01:41,318
turned this all back around in the space

13053
08:01:41,318 --> 08:01:43,798
of just this 5 to 7 minutes and this is

13054
08:01:43,798 --> 08:01:45,680
the spirit breaker problem what happens

13055
08:01:45,680 --> 08:01:46,840
when you enter the mid game and this

13056
08:01:46,840 --> 08:01:48,680
hero starts to take over the lanes get

13057
08:01:48,680 --> 08:01:51,040
mega farmed and suddenly one charger

13058
08:01:51,040 --> 08:01:53,520
down half your HP ink swell just makes

13059
08:01:53,520 --> 08:01:55,600
this combo even more

13060
08:01:55,600 --> 08:01:58,040
oppressive the only real an is you just

13061
08:01:58,040 --> 08:01:59,398
the fight on your terms with the Primal

13062
08:01:59,398 --> 08:02:01,718
split going in with a Haun and delete

13063
08:02:01,718 --> 08:02:03,398
the supports create a situation where

13064
08:02:03,398 --> 08:02:04,718
you have numbers Advantage even when the

13065
08:02:04,718 --> 08:02:05,878
charge comes through you don't care

13066
08:02:05,878 --> 08:02:07,280
because you have the longevity and Ace

13067
08:02:07,280 --> 08:02:09,160
to deal with it if you're just getting

13068
08:02:09,160 --> 08:02:11,200
caught in the open like that it's a

13069
08:02:11,200 --> 08:02:13,200
death sentence right now collapse is

13070
08:02:13,200 --> 08:02:15,718
just running the map

13071
08:02:15,718 --> 08:02:18,360
literally he is getting six slotted very

13072
08:02:18,360 --> 08:02:20,440
fast and the question is do you have

13073
08:02:20,440 --> 08:02:21,958
good late game answers to the spear

13074
08:02:21,958 --> 08:02:23,638
breaker here if you're

13075
08:02:23,638 --> 08:02:25,878
gaming outside of tossing him in the air

13076
08:02:25,878 --> 08:02:28,798
dispelling him before bkb

13077
08:02:28,798 --> 08:02:29,920
not really right none of those

13078
08:02:29,920 --> 08:02:31,638
traditional answers Like a Shadow Demon

13079
08:02:31,638 --> 08:02:34,200
or the soul bind which is on team spirit

13080
08:02:34,200 --> 08:02:35,440
Side

13081
08:02:35,440 --> 08:02:37,840
Y and that'll be a problem especially if

13082
08:02:37,840 --> 08:02:39,520
collaps is able to use that charge to

13083
08:02:39,520 --> 08:02:41,280
kill those

13084
08:02:41,280 --> 08:02:44,878
grings that charge damage

13085
08:02:44,878 --> 08:02:49,040
is pretty heavy 31 to 22 4,000 net worth

13086
08:02:49,040 --> 08:02:52,398
lead for team spirit is that managed to

13087
08:02:52,398 --> 08:02:54,718
turn this game around and continue to

13088
08:02:54,718 --> 08:02:56,840
dodge attempts by Gaming Gladiators you

13089
08:02:56,840 --> 08:02:58,440
can see the window been taken out of the

13090
08:02:58,440 --> 08:03:00,718
gaming Gladiator sale Dao is not playing

13091
08:03:00,718 --> 08:03:02,000
with that same kind of fearless that he

13092
08:03:02,000 --> 08:03:04,638
once was where anytime a hero showed up

13093
08:03:04,638 --> 08:03:06,160
he would just instantly jump and see if

13094
08:03:06,160 --> 08:03:08,040
he can get the kill yeah the map has

13095
08:03:08,040 --> 08:03:10,318
just gone dark you have one defensive op

13096
08:03:10,318 --> 08:03:11,718
of your gaming but those days of where

13097
08:03:11,718 --> 08:03:13,200
you were picking people off on Spirit

13098
08:03:13,200 --> 08:03:14,760
side of the map have come and gone

13099
08:03:14,760 --> 08:03:16,280
you're now entering their portion of the

13100
08:03:16,280 --> 08:03:17,958
game you kind of have to get around this

13101
08:03:17,958 --> 08:03:20,040
you can go late here Spectre plus the

13102
08:03:20,040 --> 08:03:21,280
brew master especially with how much

13103
08:03:21,280 --> 08:03:22,520
farm ases found in this game are going

13104
08:03:22,520 --> 08:03:24,520
to continue to scale pretty damn hard

13105
08:03:24,520 --> 08:03:25,440
and of course you always have this

13106
08:03:25,440 --> 08:03:27,040
option of like tossing the Dazzle in the

13107
08:03:27,040 --> 08:03:28,558
fight with the Wind Panda and taking the

13108
08:03:28,558 --> 08:03:30,200
fight that way it's a pretty damn good

13109
08:03:30,200 --> 08:03:31,478
option a pretty good way to deal with

13110
08:03:31,478 --> 08:03:33,718
Dazzle in a lot of the historic matchups

13111
08:03:33,718 --> 08:03:35,798
between these two

13112
08:03:35,798 --> 08:03:38,000
Heroes but you got to keep scaling on

13113
08:03:38,000 --> 08:03:40,760
everybody the Mora and the AA scale is

13114
08:03:40,760 --> 08:03:42,040
really important here for gaming if you

13115
08:03:42,040 --> 08:03:44,478
can get a fourth core out of this Mora

13116
08:03:44,478 --> 08:03:46,840
which you know tofu has a full link he's

13117
08:03:46,840 --> 08:03:49,280
very farmed none of it is like direct

13118
08:03:49,280 --> 08:03:50,760
wor the damage you know he doesn't have

13119
08:03:50,760 --> 08:03:53,160
like an A or me near Silver edge of his

13120
08:03:53,160 --> 08:03:56,000
own but can only expect so much still it

13121
08:03:56,000 --> 08:03:57,240
will deal a decent amount of damage you

13122
08:03:57,240 --> 08:03:59,200
can lock your in the calling post bkb

13123
08:03:59,200 --> 08:04:01,318
that's the

13124
08:04:01,318 --> 08:04:05,040
dream little pump fake

13125
08:04:05,478 --> 08:04:08,478
action next fight coming up all about

13126
08:04:08,478 --> 08:04:10,840
Roshan 10 seconds till that potential

13127
08:04:10,840 --> 08:04:13,280
spawn time and then we'll see when he's

13128
08:04:13,280 --> 08:04:16,160
actually get a show up also celer went

13129
08:04:16,160 --> 08:04:17,478
back for this ancient Apparition blink

13130
08:04:17,478 --> 08:04:18,520
something we've seen develop in this

13131
08:04:18,520 --> 08:04:20,718
meta he is looking for that a blast on

13132
08:04:20,718 --> 08:04:22,760
the big course The Dazzle in the CK

13133
08:04:22,760 --> 08:04:24,600
especially that is who he wants to hit

13134
08:04:24,600 --> 08:04:26,040
cannot get snowball dodged you can't

13135
08:04:26,040 --> 08:04:27,878
really just a some random support it's

13136
08:04:27,878 --> 08:04:28,878
not going to be good enough to win the

13137
08:04:28,878 --> 08:04:31,240
fight need to connect this ult on a big

13138
08:04:31,240 --> 08:04:32,360
Target and collapse he's just going to

13139
08:04:32,360 --> 08:04:34,558
lead the charge with bulldo here not

13140
08:04:34,558 --> 08:04:36,200
afraid of too much while bold carries on

13141
08:04:36,200 --> 08:04:38,280
the other side of the map look at him

13142
08:04:38,280 --> 08:04:40,680
just running in there this is a fight

13143
08:04:40,680 --> 08:04:43,600
without yoro oh that Ward somehow slips

13144
08:04:43,600 --> 08:04:46,718
past detection oh no he's got it gets

13145
08:04:46,718 --> 08:04:48,478
him with the dispel on the old scepter

13146
08:04:48,478 --> 08:04:50,280
but it is going to celerate his life he

13147
08:04:50,280 --> 08:04:51,280
does have a fight back he's going to

13148
08:04:51,280 --> 08:04:52,840
play for it Quinn off the mark there

13149
08:04:52,840 --> 08:04:54,718
with his blink in trying to hit some

13150
08:04:54,718 --> 08:04:56,160
Heroes but they've already popped their

13151
08:04:56,160 --> 08:04:58,120
bkb going resetting a little bit Del

13152
08:04:58,120 --> 08:04:59,200
he's going to try and walk back into

13153
08:04:59,200 --> 08:05:00,600
this fight he's got to be careful though

13154
08:05:00,600 --> 08:05:02,920
he may get caught by collapse he spots

13155
08:05:02,920 --> 08:05:05,360
him the tower yeah that ancient

13156
08:05:05,360 --> 08:05:07,280
Apparition got no more ice Blast for you

13157
08:05:07,280 --> 08:05:09,080
to be able to use Ace has to use his

13158
08:05:09,080 --> 08:05:10,840
ultimate he knew the atoro was gunning

13159
08:05:10,840 --> 08:05:12,478
for him there he could have chain

13160
08:05:12,478 --> 08:05:15,120
stunned up now they back away Primal

13161
08:05:15,120 --> 08:05:16,638
split being used if they can get

13162
08:05:16,638 --> 08:05:18,718
everybody out it's a dream for team SP

13163
08:05:18,718 --> 08:05:20,240
collapse is making that momentum though

13164
08:05:20,240 --> 08:05:22,200
push back by the void Panda now hit by

13165
08:05:22,200 --> 08:05:23,760
the orchin if they can kill collapse

13166
08:05:23,760 --> 08:05:24,840
that'd be great but he has so many

13167
08:05:24,840 --> 08:05:27,240
dispels and so many Ys jumping in going

13168
08:05:27,240 --> 08:05:28,958
for the back L the bango's been caught

13169
08:05:28,958 --> 08:05:31,638
and yoro he destroys him so instantly

13170
08:05:31,638 --> 08:05:34,120
now turns his damage on the D back by

13171
08:05:34,120 --> 08:05:36,398
collapse a Char on through tofu he do

13172
08:05:36,398 --> 08:05:37,718
manage to get the for St down to low

13173
08:05:37,718 --> 08:05:39,360
ground does get a dead shot onto

13174
08:05:39,360 --> 08:05:41,000
collapse but he's still pretty damn

13175
08:05:41,000 --> 08:05:42,920
healthy and they can't turn this one

13176
08:05:42,920 --> 08:05:45,760
around it is all team spirit and they

13177
08:05:45,760 --> 08:05:48,920
will Feast on the brew master last team

13178
08:05:48,920 --> 08:05:50,718
fight decision making just off the

13179
08:05:50,718 --> 08:05:52,680
charts here I mean the king dealing with

13180
08:05:52,680 --> 08:05:54,280
the ult they just make it look way too

13181
08:05:54,280 --> 08:05:56,878
easy right now and so many Charges going

13182
08:05:56,878 --> 08:05:58,280
through from collap he is looking for

13183
08:05:58,280 --> 08:05:59,878
the high five and he will get it here

13184
08:05:59,878 --> 08:06:02,760
that was a fight for Roshan but it is

13185
08:06:02,760 --> 08:06:04,760
now a fight to hit High

13186
08:06:04,760 --> 08:06:07,680
Ground for ages

13187
08:06:07,680 --> 08:06:09,958
uhoh what are you going to do if you

13188
08:06:09,958 --> 08:06:11,280
don't have the BuyBacks or you're not

13189
08:06:11,280 --> 08:06:12,478
willing to commit them right here you

13190
08:06:12,478 --> 08:06:14,160
don't even have the Primal split if a is

13191
08:06:14,160 --> 08:06:16,398
back he doesn't even have the buyback

13192
08:06:16,398 --> 08:06:19,558
you are short offensive swing short on

13193
08:06:19,558 --> 08:06:21,958
so many levels right now collaps even

13194
08:06:21,958 --> 08:06:24,000
Ting a bruing because he knew the

13195
08:06:24,000 --> 08:06:25,958
Lincoln was coming back up on tou just

13196
08:06:25,958 --> 08:06:27,160
to get back in there and get another

13197
08:06:27,160 --> 08:06:30,000
charge through lead is absolutely

13198
08:06:30,000 --> 08:06:31,760
exploding here for team spirit as they

13199
08:06:31,760 --> 08:06:34,798
are sensing potentially a second agis

13200
08:06:34,798 --> 08:06:37,280
going their

13201
08:06:37,558 --> 08:06:39,680
way one

13202
08:06:39,680 --> 08:06:44,200
more and a ran to take team spirit they

13203
08:06:44,200 --> 08:06:47,280
still have time on the clock 30 seconds

13204
08:06:47,280 --> 08:06:49,680
left on The Brew Masters revive that is

13205
08:06:49,680 --> 08:06:53,280
more than enough to get this Agger and a

13206
08:06:53,280 --> 08:06:55,318
crystallis they were winning that fight

13207
08:06:55,318 --> 08:06:58,558
now they've got like 10,000 more gold of

13208
08:06:58,558 --> 08:07:00,200
items to be able to use with an agent

13209
08:07:00,200 --> 08:07:01,520
and cheese and all these other items

13210
08:07:01,520 --> 08:07:03,000
flowing in now you've got a grim shoke

13211
08:07:03,000 --> 08:07:04,958
with an agon sceptor a silver Edge fully

13212
08:07:04,958 --> 08:07:06,958
complete they are creating too many

13213
08:07:06,958 --> 08:07:08,360
problems you can't deal with any of them

13214
08:07:08,360 --> 08:07:10,600
level 25 also coming out on collapse so

13215
08:07:10,600 --> 08:07:12,638
even more Bashers on top of the aegs if

13216
08:07:12,638 --> 08:07:13,878
you thought this spear breaker was

13217
08:07:13,878 --> 08:07:15,080
causing your problems before he's going

13218
08:07:15,080 --> 08:07:18,080
to be causing him double now just no

13219
08:07:18,080 --> 08:07:19,958
control for him and he's way too tanky

13220
08:07:19,958 --> 08:07:21,878
to try and burst Theo was just not doing

13221
08:07:21,878 --> 08:07:24,000
enough single Target DPS at this

13222
08:07:24,000 --> 08:07:26,080
point you're going to need one hell of a

13223
08:07:26,080 --> 08:07:29,240
long drawn out fight

13224
08:07:29,240 --> 08:07:33,240
team spirit crazy they're up 20 in this

13225
08:07:33,240 --> 08:07:35,478
series they they're down in this game

13226
08:07:35,478 --> 08:07:38,080
three they have a 5% chance to make it

13227
08:07:38,080 --> 08:07:39,920
back in sure they could just give it up

13228
08:07:39,920 --> 08:07:41,520
say well guys it's the best to find we

13229
08:07:41,520 --> 08:07:43,280
can give them one but they claw their

13230
08:07:43,280 --> 08:07:44,840
way back into this game are now in a

13231
08:07:44,840 --> 08:07:48,398
commanding position to potentially three

13232
08:07:48,398 --> 08:07:50,798
The Challengers and gaming Gladiators

13233
08:07:50,798 --> 08:07:52,520
that is what makes us team absolutely

13234
08:07:52,520 --> 08:07:54,080
terrifying at this point in tournaments

13235
08:07:54,080 --> 08:07:55,840
and we saw everybody from all these

13236
08:07:55,840 --> 08:07:57,160
teams talk about it right if you get

13237
08:07:57,160 --> 08:07:59,840
ahead of this team what does it mean it

13238
08:07:59,840 --> 08:08:01,478
just means when they might beat you it

13239
08:08:01,478 --> 08:08:04,040
feels even worse right now this game has

13240
08:08:04,040 --> 08:08:06,318
turned itself on the head as you said

13241
08:08:06,318 --> 08:08:09,600
over 20k lead AG is up for 4 minutes so

13242
08:08:09,600 --> 08:08:11,440
it'll be up to yoro in terms of whether

13243
08:08:11,440 --> 08:08:12,718
he wants to push The High Ground during

13244
08:08:12,718 --> 08:08:14,478
this interval and trying in this game he

13245
08:08:14,478 --> 08:08:16,920
feels like he needs even more there's

13246
08:08:16,920 --> 08:08:19,318
still a lot of room to grow here they

13247
08:08:19,318 --> 08:08:21,600
did finish up an A on moska as well so

13248
08:08:21,600 --> 08:08:22,798
now you can start to get some dark

13249
08:08:22,798 --> 08:08:25,440
portraits in the mix just add even more

13250
08:08:25,440 --> 08:08:27,478
chaos and confusion to the fight more

13251
08:08:27,478 --> 08:08:30,920
damage sources yoro qu blink it away no

13252
08:08:30,920 --> 08:08:33,080
fear can't get

13253
08:08:33,080 --> 08:08:36,718
caught otherwise that is welcoming team

13254
08:08:36,718 --> 08:08:38,360
spirit into your

13255
08:08:38,360 --> 08:08:41,240
base charge complete half his health

13256
08:08:41,240 --> 08:08:42,760
fuel scepter is going to be used nicely

13257
08:08:42,760 --> 08:08:45,520
breaken with that Lincoln but he didn't

13258
08:08:45,520 --> 08:08:48,440
use that bulldo towards the end there

13259
08:08:48,440 --> 08:08:49,718
and these are just free they have the

13260
08:08:49,718 --> 08:08:52,360
ways to get collaps out every time

13261
08:08:52,360 --> 08:08:53,920
there's a Lincoln there's a swell

13262
08:08:53,920 --> 08:08:55,958
there's four staffs

13263
08:08:55,958 --> 08:08:58,878
grave the to going to take his chance to

13264
08:08:58,878 --> 08:09:02,600
Tak first down oh man before you can

13265
08:09:02,600 --> 08:09:04,280
even complete the sent he's already gone

13266
08:09:04,280 --> 08:09:05,520
they do have an ice blast though that's

13267
08:09:05,520 --> 08:09:06,840
pretty well positioned Dao's already

13268
08:09:06,840 --> 08:09:08,080
cleaned up the grimstroke it's not too

13269
08:09:08,080 --> 08:09:09,920
bad but Daio he needs to get out of

13270
08:09:09,920 --> 08:09:13,280
there oh my God that's so much so much

13271
08:09:13,280 --> 08:09:15,360
damage Spectre has to win this now but

13272
08:09:15,360 --> 08:09:17,040
he has to be careful that Dazz they have

13273
08:09:17,040 --> 08:09:18,638
to be able to take away this agis at the

13274
08:09:18,638 --> 08:09:20,958
bare minimum surely they have to go for

13275
08:09:20,958 --> 08:09:22,558
more they have to risk it collapse going

13276
08:09:22,558 --> 08:09:24,000
to charge on through to make sure you

13277
08:09:24,000 --> 08:09:25,718
can't set up on utoro now utoro will

13278
08:09:25,718 --> 08:09:27,120
turn back around on you he's ready for

13279
08:09:27,120 --> 08:09:29,318
that fight he pulled back in Daio this

13280
08:09:29,318 --> 08:09:31,000
could be it for gaming Gladiators unless

13281
08:09:31,000 --> 08:09:32,600
they find a way out of it quin's Dead

13282
08:09:32,600 --> 08:09:35,760

will be a oneman stand against what is

13287
08:09:48,080 --> 08:09:49,958
looking like the best team in the world

13288
08:09:49,958 --> 08:09:51,600
right now absolutely as they take a

13289
08:09:51,600 --> 08:09:54,360
commanding team fight Victory inside G's

13290
08:09:54,360 --> 08:09:56,520
base no buyback on the brew master there

13291
08:09:56,520 --> 08:09:58,318
they just delete the highest net worth

13292
08:09:58,318 --> 08:10:01,240
hero for gaming straight off the bat no

13293
08:10:01,240 --> 08:10:02,878
turnaround potential and you are running

13294
08:10:02,878 --> 08:10:04,318
out of lives you are running out of

13295
08:10:04,318 --> 08:10:07,520
games to play here as team spirit they

13296
08:10:07,520 --> 08:10:08,520
don't want to just be the best team in

13297
08:10:08,520 --> 08:10:09,638
the world they want to prove that they

13298
08:10:09,638 --> 08:10:11,398
are one of the best teams ever to Grace

13299
08:10:11,398 --> 08:10:13,000
this stage right now and they are

13300
08:10:13,000 --> 08:10:14,360
showing why they're going to go for the

13301
08:10:14,360 --> 08:10:17,760
megas play it safe and a finished on mea

13302
08:10:17,760 --> 08:10:19,240

08:10:19,240 --> 08:10:21,360
out of the tournament if he has his way

13304
08:10:21,360 --> 08:10:22,920
and they're going to go right for the

13305
08:10:22,920 --> 08:10:26,160
throne quick reactions from Quinn has to

13306
08:10:26,160 --> 08:10:28,240
Blink away just one little opening as

13307
08:10:28,240 --> 08:10:30,840
all it takes with mea lurking from

13308
08:10:30,840 --> 08:10:33,520
behind Ace back up we'll see what he can

13309
08:10:33,520 --> 08:10:36,040
do to stall this out going to need one

13310
08:10:36,040 --> 08:10:38,920
hell of a primal split

13311
08:10:38,920 --> 08:10:41,680
hereo starts pushing forward mea doesn't

13312
08:10:41,680 --> 08:10:42,600
quite get it there and they actually

13313
08:10:42,600 --> 08:10:43,840
stop the spear breaker right in front of

13314
08:10:43,840 --> 08:10:45,000
their base but they're locked in by the

13315
08:10:45,000 --> 08:10:46,520
shards quin's able to hop around it but

13316
08:10:46,520 --> 08:10:48,920
now this it holds him in place he can't

13317
08:10:48,920 --> 08:10:50,200
do anything against that but at least

13318
08:10:50,200 --> 08:10:52,558
the brew master can gets the thr is

13319
08:10:52,558 --> 08:10:56,120
explode and now he's been oh no it is

13320
08:10:56,120 --> 08:10:58,040
too much for gaming GL to be able to

13321
08:10:58,040 --> 08:10:59,840
handle they are not going to be able to

13322
08:10:59,840 --> 08:11:01,440
get through this they have to pray to

13323
08:11:01,440 --> 08:11:04,080
get out but the cathedral is merciless

13324
08:11:04,080 --> 08:11:06,878
it is team spirits who are unstoppable

13325
08:11:06,878 --> 08:11:09,160
they will take

13326
08:11:09,160 --> 08:11:12,760

13327
08:11:12,760 --> 08:11:16,280
world without a doubt silence every

13328
08:11:16,280 --> 08:11:19,680
other team

13329
08:11:20,120 --> 08:11:23,240
3 absolutely an incredible performance

13330
08:11:23,240 --> 08:11:24,680
in the grand finals against the best

13331
08:11:24,680 --> 08:11:26,600
team in the season an undefeated Grand

13332
08:11:26,600 --> 08:11:28,280
Final team iname game in Gladiators a

13333
08:11:28,280 --> 08:11:30,280
team that has defeated an entire lower

13334
08:11:30,280 --> 08:11:33,878
bracket to get here they take 3 in

13335
08:11:33,878 --> 08:11:36,040
record time kicked them out of this

13336
08:11:36,040 --> 08:11:38,398
event claim a second agis for the crew

13337
08:11:38,398 --> 08:11:40,520
the first one for Laurel who is fit in

13338
08:11:40,520 --> 08:11:42,958
immaculately with this roster this is a

13339
08:11:42,958 --> 08:11:44,680
team everybody had on their radar but

13340
08:11:44,680 --> 08:11:46,040
they have slowly built it up over the

13341
08:11:46,040 --> 08:11:48,200
course of the year are hitting in Prime

13342
08:11:48,200 --> 08:11:50,398
form right now and it shows this team

13343
08:11:50,398 --> 08:11:52,920
has multi- generational players and now

13344
08:11:52,920 --> 08:11:54,520
they are absolutely cementing themselves

13345
08:11:54,520 --> 08:11:56,840
as one of the best teams ever to play

13346
08:11:56,840 --> 08:11:59,200
the game M Dota 2 how do you stop these

13347
08:11:59,200 --> 08:12:01,520
guys you can't beat them early you can't

13348
08:12:01,520 --> 08:12:04,520
beat them late even when you have the

13349
08:12:04,520 --> 08:12:06,398
full advantage you have full control of

13350
08:12:06,398 --> 08:12:07,638
the game they'll beat you on the

13351
08:12:07,638 --> 08:12:11,638
comeback too team Spirits did it every

13352
08:12:11,638 --> 08:12:13,760
way

13353
08:12:13,760 --> 08:12:17,040
possible nothing is left for them but

13354
08:12:17,040 --> 08:12:18,878
the handshakes in the end for gaming

13355
08:12:18,878 --> 08:12:21,318
Gladiators who had an admirable run

13356
08:12:21,318 --> 08:12:23,680
through the lower bracket I mean it was

13357
08:12:23,680 --> 08:12:27,478
the stuff of great stories but it comes

13358

that we missed if we missed anything I

don't even think we missed anything I

13423
08:17:44,958 --> 08:17:49,360
think team spirit lost they are amazing

13424
08:17:49,360 --> 08:17:51,840
absolutely this is the team that uh you

13425
08:17:51,840 --> 08:17:53,398
know they didn't get the chance to

13426
08:17:53,398 --> 08:17:55,360
experience crowd at ti1 when they wanton

13427
08:17:55,360 --> 08:17:57,798
it and really glad that ble is cheering

13428
08:17:57,798 --> 08:17:59,160
really hard for them this is the team

13429
08:17:59,160 --> 08:18:01,238
that had a bit of a rough year at the

13430
08:18:01,238 --> 08:18:03,040
start and they started to pick it up you

13431
08:18:03,040 --> 08:18:04,798
know going into the rad Masters Dream

13432
08:18:04,798 --> 08:18:06,558
League they know when to power up this

13433
08:18:06,558 --> 08:18:08,558
is the team that enjoys playing on the

13434
08:18:08,558 --> 08:18:10,398
main stage so much you can see on their

13435
08:18:10,398 --> 08:18:13,120
faces all the smiles that's what DOA is

13436
08:18:13,120 --> 08:18:15,000
about having fun and winning some big

13437
08:18:15,000 --> 08:18:18,120
money oh yeah but my God what a team I

13438
08:18:18,120 --> 08:18:20,760
mean they are magical I feel like the

13439
08:18:20,760 --> 08:18:22,478
only other team in the history of DOTA

13440
08:18:22,478 --> 08:18:24,920
that embodied this kind of resilience

13441
08:18:24,920 --> 08:18:26,958
and passion for the game was OG and

13442
08:18:26,958 --> 08:18:29,280
former run but this team spirit it's

13443
08:18:29,280 --> 08:18:31,760
like we haven't seen anything like them

13444
08:18:31,760 --> 08:18:34,398
their players have improved so much in

13445
08:18:34,398 --> 08:18:36,600
the last year so much I can't even speak

13446
08:18:36,600 --> 08:18:39,200
to the Improvement of Meera of Laurel in

13447
08:18:39,200 --> 08:18:41,360
particular and for them to just win this

13448
08:18:41,360 --> 08:18:43,398
Aegis after a year that looked Rocky for

13449
08:18:43,398 --> 08:18:45,558
them at the start after not placing well

13450
08:18:45,558 --> 08:18:47,318
in the three Majors this year for

13451
08:18:47,318 --> 08:18:49,160
everything to suddenly fall into place

13452
08:18:49,160 --> 08:18:51,520
for everything to finally click right

13453
08:18:51,520 --> 08:18:53,680
around the corner for TI I mean if that

13454
08:18:53,680 --> 08:18:55,718
isn't Magic I don't know what is t i

13455
08:18:55,718 --> 08:18:57,040
mean just it's the fact that they have

13456
08:18:57,040 --> 08:18:58,280
these systems in place to be able to

13457
08:18:58,280 --> 08:19:00,040
shape plow into the player to become the

13458
08:19:00,040 --> 08:19:01,478
mid laner you know be able to replace

13459
08:19:01,478 --> 08:19:03,558
Toronto Tokyo again like L mentioned the

13460
08:19:03,558 --> 08:19:05,360
start of the year it will shaky they

13461
08:19:05,360 --> 08:19:06,680
barely got in the top eight of one of

13462
08:19:06,680 --> 08:19:08,798
the three majors and now here they get

13463
08:19:08,798 --> 08:19:11,238
first place and for Toronto not Toronto

13464
08:19:11,238 --> 08:19:14,558
yoro sorry two time TI winner and also

13465
08:19:14,558 --> 08:19:16,360
second ever player to get a rampage in a

13466
08:19:16,360 --> 08:19:18,638
TI finals the crowd love him he's just

13467
08:19:18,638 --> 08:19:20,440
popping off in the game like this team

13468
08:19:20,440 --> 08:19:23,000
they are just incredible I mean DOTA has

13469
08:19:23,000 --> 08:19:25,920
not seen a player like yoro for a very

13470
08:19:25,920 --> 08:19:28,638
long time he was in contention for

13471
08:19:28,638 --> 08:19:30,280
people saying he's the best carry in the

13472
08:19:30,280 --> 08:19:32,280
world the goat but he has proved that

13473
08:19:32,280 --> 08:19:34,878
here today at TI and even earlier this

13474
08:19:34,878 --> 08:19:37,238
year during the Riad Masters he carried

13475
08:19:37,238 --> 08:19:39,280
his team to Victory he fought tooth and

13476
08:19:39,280 --> 08:19:40,798
nail when they looked like they were

13477
08:19:40,798 --> 08:19:42,040
going to lose when it looked like there

13478
08:19:42,040 --> 08:19:44,280
was no hope in their games he was the

13479
08:19:44,280 --> 08:19:46,160
one to just push them forward and here

13480
08:19:46,160 --> 08:19:48,600
at TI they all connected they all came

13481
08:19:48,600 --> 08:19:50,160
together and it was just a beautiful

13482
08:19:50,160 --> 08:19:52,520
team Victory here it was a great Victory

13483
08:19:52,520 --> 08:19:54,238
great support coming out of the climate

13484
08:19:54,238 --> 08:19:55,798
pledge Arena as well and for everybody

13485
08:19:55,798 --> 08:19:57,280
in the arena I also want to make sure

13486
08:19:57,280 --> 08:19:59,160
that you guys are aware that you are

13487
08:19:59,160 --> 08:20:01,398
allowed to stay here for the late game

13488
08:20:01,398 --> 08:20:03,718
show as well so you can witness that you

13489
08:20:03,718 --> 08:20:07,718
can witness team spirit in the late game

13490
08:20:07,718 --> 08:20:10,120
show with peran flax and Jenkins so just

13491
08:20:10,120 --> 08:20:12,040
so you're aware you don't go anywhere

13492
08:20:12,040 --> 08:20:14,318
there's a lot more to come team Spirits

13493
08:20:14,318 --> 08:20:17,600
run has been fantastic we got four new

13494
08:20:17,600 --> 08:20:20,878
TI double TI Champions and I I must

13495
08:20:20,878 --> 08:20:22,600
bring it back to Laurel because his

13496
08:20:22,600 --> 08:20:24,318
story has just been fantastic you heard

13497
08:20:24,318 --> 08:20:26,638
slack say it on the main stage he came

13498
08:20:26,638 --> 08:20:30,120
dead last dead last last year and it was

13499
08:20:30,120 --> 08:20:32,398
a rocky start but there was support from

13500
08:20:32,398 --> 08:20:34,120
all his teammate support from the

13501
08:20:34,120 --> 08:20:36,798
organization we heard on the main stage

13502
08:20:36,798 --> 08:20:40,040
at Toro said at reup Masters I really

13503
08:20:40,040 --> 08:20:41,920
want to win this Championship because I

13504
08:20:41,920 --> 08:20:45,000
want Laurel to experience what it's like

13505
08:20:45,000 --> 08:20:47,760
and that he did and then he went to take

13506
08:20:47,760 --> 08:20:50,160
on the international with the same Squad

13507
08:20:50,160 --> 08:20:52,280
and T I can't believe they did it here

13508
08:20:52,280 --> 08:20:54,160
as well and they just done it in such St

13509
08:20:54,160 --> 08:20:55,878
as well like they've played so many

13510
08:20:55,878 --> 08:20:57,000
different types of Gam as well like

13511
08:20:57,000 --> 08:20:58,200
they're not just doing one thing the

13512
08:20:58,200 --> 08:20:59,760
entire time they are every single time

13513
08:20:59,760 --> 08:21:02,520
they approach a game it's a new way

13514
08:21:02,520 --> 08:21:03,920
Spirit approaches to beat their

13515
08:21:03,920 --> 08:21:05,958
opponents and I don't know it's just the

13516
08:21:05,958 --> 08:21:08,120
most commendable way to win it and sure

13517
08:21:08,120 --> 08:21:10,360
it was a 3 but it was a 30 in style and

13518
08:21:10,360 --> 08:21:11,238
yeah team

13519
08:21:11,238 --> 08:21:14,840
spirit it just so yeah like they

13520
08:21:14,840 --> 08:21:17,120
believed in lurl when you know getting

13521
08:21:17,120 --> 08:21:20,040
that last place at the and also some big

13522
08:21:20,040 --> 08:21:22,840
shoes to F this guy he's nuts every

13523
08:21:22,840 --> 08:21:24,558
single game that he played you could see

13524
08:21:24,558 --> 08:21:26,600
that he's powering up throughout the

13525
08:21:26,600 --> 08:21:28,558
tournaments you could see that he can be

13526
08:21:28,558 --> 08:21:30,040
toe totoe against some of the best

13527
08:21:30,040 --> 08:21:32,878
midlaners in the world and now he is the

13528
08:21:32,878 --> 08:21:34,680
best midlaner in the world Crown

13529
08:21:34,680 --> 08:21:37,398
immortalized absolutely what a story and

13530
08:21:37,398 --> 08:21:39,360
I mean for Laurel to play in this team

13531
08:21:39,360 --> 08:21:41,318
like Laos mentioned the shoes were big

13532
08:21:41,318 --> 08:21:42,958
the nerves were there and every time

13533
08:21:42,958 --> 08:21:45,200
team spirit performed badly he was

13534
08:21:45,200 --> 08:21:47,600
blamed there was mass criticism from the

13535
08:21:47,600 --> 08:21:49,718
fans Mass criticism of Laurel from the

13536
08:21:49,718 --> 08:21:51,600
community people were begging to have

13537
08:21:51,600 --> 08:21:53,238
this player replaced but the other

13538
08:21:53,238 --> 08:21:55,558
members of team spirit refused they

13539
08:21:55,558 --> 08:21:57,280
believed in him they said that they

13540
08:21:57,280 --> 08:21:58,840
think he has the potential they said

13541
08:21:58,840 --> 08:22:00,638
that they trust him and they know that

13542
08:22:00,638 --> 08:22:03,160
he's their mid laner and here we are at

13543
08:22:03,160 --> 08:22:06,318
TI he's won it yeah immortalized on his

13544
08:22:06,318 --> 08:22:09,280
Dazzle at that I just want to take a a a

13545
08:22:09,280 --> 08:22:13,238
small moment to just iterate the

13546
08:22:13,238 --> 08:22:15,360
wallpaper every time is the heroes that

13547
08:22:15,360 --> 08:22:18,040
one TI we have chaos night Dazzle and

13548
08:22:18,040 --> 08:22:20,520
Spirit Break as our boards on that

13549
08:22:20,520 --> 08:22:22,600

13550
08:22:22,600 --> 08:22:24,360
embodiment here oh that's so so

13551
08:22:24,360 --> 08:22:26,080

times the good times will be remembered

13556
08:22:34,760 --> 08:22:38,878
for a very long time to come I also know

13557
08:22:38,878 --> 08:22:40,600
that the average age of players here

13558
08:22:40,600 --> 08:22:41,760
this might be a random point the average

13559
08:22:41,760 --> 08:22:43,520
age of players playing at TI is around

13560
08:22:43,520 --> 08:22:48,440
23 years old yoro is 20 years old he won

13561
08:22:48,440 --> 08:22:51,360
his first International at 17 now his

13562
08:22:51,360 --> 08:22:54,000
second International at 20 La cost I

13563
08:22:54,000 --> 08:22:57,440
mean not not to think about you going he

13564
08:22:57,440 --> 08:22:59,318
pretty much played for only one team

13565
08:22:59,318 --> 08:23:01,160
Yellow Submarine which kind of turned

13566
08:23:01,160 --> 08:23:03,318
into team spirit the other members of

13567
08:23:03,318 --> 08:23:05,318
the team LL who started to play

13568
08:23:05,318 --> 08:23:07,718
professional DOTA in 2021 collaps he

13569
08:23:07,718 --> 08:23:09,600
only played for three teams Mira only

13570
08:23:09,600 --> 08:23:11,558
two teams one of them also being you

13571
08:23:11,558 --> 08:23:13,840
know just predecessor to Yellow

13572
08:23:13,840 --> 08:23:16,040
Submarine and the veteran moska leading

13573
08:23:16,040 --> 08:23:17,760
the team you know so you have this mix

13574
08:23:17,760 --> 08:23:19,920
of a new blood and also some veteran

13575
08:23:19,920 --> 08:23:21,120
player that's going to lead them to the

13576
08:23:21,120 --> 08:23:22,638
victory I mean the key thing here is the

13577
08:23:22,638 --> 08:23:24,520
future of D DOTA is bright right like

13578
08:23:24,520 --> 08:23:25,840
when you think about the players here

13579
08:23:25,840 --> 08:23:27,718
the 20 years old 22 years old like

13580
08:23:27,718 --> 08:23:28,760
they've only been playing competitive

13581
08:23:28,760 --> 08:23:30,920
DOTA for what nearly four 5 years some

13582
08:23:30,920 --> 08:23:32,718
of them like these are the ones lifting

13583
08:23:32,718 --> 08:23:34,360
the ages time and time again and it's

13584
08:23:34,360 --> 08:23:37,398
like yeah it's just so good to see and

13585
08:23:37,398 --> 08:23:38,920
also I just want to highlight the

13586
08:23:38,920 --> 08:23:41,200
support Duo of team spirit I mean we've

13587
08:23:41,200 --> 08:23:42,958
talked about Laurel we've talked about

13588
08:23:42,958 --> 08:23:44,478
collaps we talked about uro and these

13589
08:23:44,478 --> 08:23:47,080
are incredible players but moska and mea

13590
08:23:47,080 --> 08:23:49,160
are the heart of this team they are the

13591
08:23:49,160 --> 08:23:52,440
backbone of this team they play so well

13592
08:23:52,440 --> 08:23:54,600
every game and their praises go unsung

13593
08:23:54,600 --> 08:23:56,638
because it's so hard to shine on team

13594
08:23:56,638 --> 08:23:58,318
with someone like itoro right but

13595
08:23:58,318 --> 08:24:00,120
they're so consistent they're there with

13596
08:24:00,120 --> 08:24:01,920
the saves they're there with the lanan

13597
08:24:01,920 --> 08:24:03,798
they're there with the pressure they do

13598
08:24:03,798 --> 08:24:04,920
everything right and they have done

13599
08:24:04,920 --> 08:24:07,000
everything right This Ti yeah and for

13600
08:24:07,000 --> 08:24:09,520
moska especially we know that his first

13601
08:24:09,520 --> 08:24:11,520
his first recorded professional results

13602
08:24:11,520 --> 08:24:15,040
were in 2015 but he's been around for a

13603
08:24:15,040 --> 08:24:18,558
very long time La cost and this guy this

13604
08:24:18,558 --> 08:24:21,638
is his second TI win what a crowning

13605
08:24:21,638 --> 08:24:24,280
achievement at such a successful career

13606
08:24:24,280 --> 08:24:26,160
absolutely this guy is just amazing you

13607
08:24:26,160 --> 08:24:28,398
know whenever we get the chance to talk

13608
08:24:28,398 --> 08:24:30,798
to him like the Insight that he gives of

13609
08:24:30,798 --> 08:24:32,120
course he doesn't want to reveal

13610
08:24:32,120 --> 08:24:33,718
everything maybe after TI we're going to

13611
08:24:33,718 --> 08:24:35,958
see in some of these Vlogs this guy is

13612
08:24:35,958 --> 08:24:37,600
just a rock of the team like you can

13613
08:24:37,600 --> 08:24:39,360
rely on him he's going to be carrying

13614
08:24:39,360 --> 08:24:41,000
the game on some of his signature Heroes

13615
08:24:41,000 --> 08:24:42,798
when it's necessary this guy is just a

13616
08:24:42,798 --> 08:24:45,080
menace to play against and he has that

13617
08:24:45,080 --> 08:24:47,120
you know compassion that embodies a

13618
08:24:47,120 --> 08:24:48,680
leader in a team like this if you've

13619
08:24:48,680 --> 08:24:50,080
ever interacted with him or heard him

13620
08:24:50,080 --> 08:24:52,440
speak of his teammates he views them so

13621
08:24:52,440 --> 08:24:54,360
fondly he's very calm he's not the type

13622
08:24:54,360 --> 08:24:56,040
of person to lead with anger to lead

13623
08:24:56,040 --> 08:24:58,440
with a form of aggression he's he's one

13624
08:24:58,440 --> 08:24:59,878
of those captains that just leads

13625
08:24:59,878 --> 08:25:01,958
through friendship and as cliche as that

13626
08:25:01,958 --> 08:25:04,200
sounds that is who he is yeah and it

13627
08:25:04,200 --> 08:25:06,200
beds into the team as well because when

13628
08:25:06,200 --> 08:25:07,520
when they're even behind when they're

13629
08:25:07,520 --> 08:25:08,760
down they're still smiling they're still

13630
08:25:08,760 --> 08:25:10,080
having fun like how often do you see a

13631
08:25:10,080 --> 08:25:11,680
pro team when they're you know backs

13632
08:25:11,680 --> 08:25:12,798
against the wall they're still enjoying

13633
08:25:12,798 --> 08:25:14,318
the game like team spirit throughout

13634
08:25:14,318 --> 08:25:16,120
this entire Journey not only were they

13635
08:25:16,120 --> 08:25:18,120
the best team but they just enjoyed

13636
08:25:18,120 --> 08:25:20,080
every single moment and it's why they

13637
08:25:20,080 --> 08:25:22,920
able to be so successful at TI 10 they

13638
08:25:22,920 --> 08:25:24,958
won first two games then they lost two

13639
08:25:24,958 --> 08:25:27,398
games but this time around I2 they made

13640
08:25:27,398 --> 08:25:29,680
it look very easy two games were

13641
08:25:29,680 --> 08:25:32,080
complete you know obliteration coming

13642
08:25:32,080 --> 08:25:33,840
out from team spirit in the third game

13643
08:25:33,840 --> 08:25:36,398
4% and they still managed to come back

13644
08:25:36,398 --> 08:25:38,600
DOTA plus not really you know team

13645
08:25:38,600 --> 08:25:41,080
spirit they're all against the odds 4%

13646
08:25:41,080 --> 08:25:44,000
it was by the way yeah 4% to win that

13647
08:25:44,000 --> 08:25:45,440
yeah that's fantastic I mean the game

13648
08:25:45,440 --> 08:25:47,200
was very close it just shows a lot of

13649
08:25:47,200 --> 08:25:48,398
character that they were able to beat

13650
08:25:48,398 --> 08:25:50,680
back hey exactly I mean this is the

13651
08:25:50,680 --> 08:25:52,360
spirit of this of this team this is what

13652
08:25:52,360 --> 08:25:54,160
they embody they are determined even

13653
08:25:54,160 --> 08:25:55,440
when they're playing with a net worth

13654
08:25:55,440 --> 08:25:57,318
deficit they never play like they are

13655
08:25:57,318 --> 08:25:58,558
they play like they're always in the

13656
08:25:58,558 --> 08:25:59,920
lead they play like there's always a

13657
08:25:59,920 --> 08:26:01,638
means into the game and you've heard

13658
08:26:01,638 --> 08:26:04,478
from the teams who have lost a spirit or

13659
08:26:04,478 --> 08:26:06,398
won against Spirit they always say

13660
08:26:06,398 --> 08:26:07,920
regardless of winning against this team

13661
08:26:07,920 --> 08:26:10,120
they exhaust you they make you tired

13662
08:26:10,120 --> 08:26:11,718
they fight for the entirety of the game

13663
08:26:11,718 --> 08:26:14,520
for every inch of the map and I mean

13664
08:26:14,520 --> 08:26:15,760
that's why they're here that's why they

13665
08:26:15,760 --> 08:26:18,160
lifted the ages that is why they lifted

13666
08:26:18,160 --> 08:26:20,718
the ages through hard work they they

13667
08:26:20,718 --> 08:26:23,398
worked really hard this this year to get

13668
08:26:23,398 --> 08:26:25,120
to the point where they were on their

13669
08:26:25,120 --> 08:26:26,878
team Synergy and on their go of course

13670
08:26:26,878 --> 08:26:28,718
as well they went through the upper

13671
08:26:28,718 --> 08:26:32,160
bracket they only dropped this entire TI

13672
08:26:32,160 --> 08:26:34,840
Run Road to the international and all

13673
08:26:34,840 --> 08:26:38,000
they only dropped two games T only two

13674
08:26:38,000 --> 08:26:39,520
it's just crazy to think about and

13675
08:26:39,520 --> 08:26:40,920
especially like the group stage it was

13676
08:26:40,920 --> 08:26:43,440
so clean for them they dropped a game to

13677
08:26:43,440 --> 08:26:46,040
verus Pro a regional opponent dropped a

13678
08:26:46,040 --> 08:26:47,600
game to liquid as well and then as soon

13679
08:26:47,600 --> 08:26:49,200
as they went against lgd I feel like

13680
08:26:49,200 --> 08:26:50,840
they just leveled up and of course Yar I

13681
08:26:50,840 --> 08:26:52,440
me he shaved his head like do did you

13682
08:26:52,440 --> 08:26:54,200
expect any other result today sacrifice

13683
08:26:54,200 --> 08:26:55,318
was made I mean he is the most

13684
08:26:55,318 --> 08:26:57,638
successful to go B pro player ever in

13685
08:26:57,638 --> 08:26:58,840
the history people have followed in his

13686
08:26:58,840 --> 08:27:00,760
footsteps failed miserably he has two

13687
08:27:00,760 --> 08:27:03,520
times in a row done it bam two wins he's

13688
08:27:03,520 --> 08:27:05,398
the only one who can wield that power

13689
08:27:05,398 --> 08:27:07,958
okay this power exists within Yo's realm

13690
08:27:07,958 --> 08:27:09,318
it's not something for other mere

13691
08:27:09,318 --> 08:27:11,718
mortals to shave their heads and win TI

13692
08:27:11,718 --> 08:27:14,360
but on the topic of one more player I do

13693
08:27:14,360 --> 08:27:16,558
really want to give my commends and mea

13694
08:27:16,558 --> 08:27:18,478
his flowers because I remember after he

13695
08:27:18,478 --> 08:27:20,760
won TI 10 he did a few interviews where

13696
08:27:20,760 --> 08:27:23,000
he said that he felt like an imposter he

13697
08:27:23,000 --> 08:27:24,798
didn't feel good enough to be a TI

13698
08:27:24,798 --> 08:27:27,080
winner he didn't feel he didn't feel

13699
08:27:27,080 --> 08:27:28,638
like this was valid he didn't

13700
08:27:28,638 --> 08:27:30,440
necessarily get that sense that he was

13701
08:27:30,440 --> 08:27:32,238
one of the best players in the world so

13702
08:27:32,238 --> 08:27:34,520
now that he's a two-time TI winner I

13703
08:27:34,520 --> 08:27:36,160
really hope that that impostor syndrome

13704
08:27:36,160 --> 08:27:38,080
can go away because he's proven it not

13705
08:27:38,080 --> 08:27:40,160
just to himself to his fans but to us

13706
08:27:40,160 --> 08:27:41,920
the DOTA Community the rest of the world

13707
08:27:41,920 --> 08:27:43,840
yeah they need to update this picture

13708
08:27:43,840 --> 08:27:45,798
I'm sorry this is

13709
08:27:45,798 --> 08:27:48,160
unable they do I mean to be honest I

13710
08:27:48,160 --> 08:27:49,760
don't think but we've seen other Pros

13711
08:27:49,760 --> 08:27:51,558
attempt to shave their head to embody a

13712
08:27:51,558 --> 08:27:53,360
Toro's power but let's be real that

13713
08:27:53,360 --> 08:27:56,160
power is his own and it it works for him

13714
08:27:56,160 --> 08:27:58,478
it works for the team they have done it

13715
08:27:58,478 --> 08:28:00,360
they have taken the ages for the second

13716
08:28:00,360 --> 08:28:02,680
time round which is an incredible

13717
08:28:02,680 --> 08:28:04,558
achievement so congratulations once

13718
08:28:04,558 --> 08:28:07,840
again to team spirit for having their

13719
08:28:07,840 --> 08:28:09,600
Victory I feel like we also need to give

13720
08:28:09,600 --> 08:28:11,040
a little bit of light there to gaming

13721
08:28:11,040 --> 08:28:12,478
Gladiators because they also had a

13722
08:28:12,478 --> 08:28:14,160
fantastic run they came second at this

13723
08:28:14,160 --> 08:28:16,600
International and that is not something

13724
08:28:16,600 --> 08:28:18,398
to be ashamed of it might feel really

13725
08:28:18,398 --> 08:28:20,440
rough right about now especially after

13726
08:28:20,440 --> 08:28:22,798
that third game which was a game they

13727
08:28:22,798 --> 08:28:25,200
were very close Laos to be able to to

13728
08:28:25,200 --> 08:28:27,440
force out a absolutely I mean gaming

13729
08:28:27,440 --> 08:28:28,878
Gladiators they were the team to beat

13730
08:28:28,878 --> 08:28:30,520
throughout this year like all three

13731
08:28:30,520 --> 08:28:33,160
Majors were won by them throughout the

13732
08:28:33,160 --> 08:28:35,360
upper bracket and they did look they

13733
08:28:35,360 --> 08:28:36,638
look like a team that's not going to

13734
08:28:36,638 --> 08:28:38,638
stop but unfortunately for them team

13735
08:28:38,638 --> 08:28:40,958
spirit they did power up at the right

13736
08:28:40,958 --> 08:28:43,200
time and also gaming Gladiators they

13737
08:28:43,200 --> 08:28:45,440
also had really really good tournament

13738
08:28:45,440 --> 08:28:47,120
so far you know dropping down to lower

13739
08:28:47,120 --> 08:28:49,280
bracket and making the magical run

13740
08:28:49,280 --> 08:28:50,958
unfortunately team spirit they were too

13741
08:28:50,958 --> 08:28:53,280
strong today they were very much too

13742
08:28:53,280 --> 08:28:55,478
strong today and while we witness team

13743
08:28:55,478 --> 08:28:57,958
spirits ictory a lot of people around

13744
08:28:57,958 --> 08:29:01,200
the world were able to cheer them on and

13745
08:29:01,200 --> 08:29:04,000
reel in their Victory this is Moscow we

13746
08:29:04,000 --> 08:29:07,280
have so many pop stops happening around

13747
08:29:07,280 --> 08:29:09,760
the world I also want to say once again

13748
08:29:09,760 --> 08:29:11,920
late game is coming right after this so

13749
08:29:11,920 --> 08:29:13,958
you don't even have to leave I know a

13750
08:29:13,958 --> 08:29:15,680
lot of people were having their time

13751
08:29:15,680 --> 08:29:18,120
slot booked out for a full best of five

13752
08:29:18,120 --> 08:29:19,718
we might not have gotten that but there

13753
08:29:19,718 --> 08:29:22,520
is still more content coming on this

13754
08:29:22,520 --> 08:29:24,520
very Channel and in the climate pledge

13755
08:29:24,520 --> 08:29:27,558
Arena as well oh so much love coming

13756
08:29:27,558 --> 08:29:29,638
from around the world here for Dota 2

13757
08:29:29,638 --> 08:29:31,600
and its World Championship the

13758
08:29:31,600 --> 08:29:33,718
international was taken by team spirit

13759
08:29:33,718 --> 08:29:35,760
but truly the real winners are all the

13760
08:29:35,760 --> 08:29:38,558
fans and I know I know that there are so

13761
08:29:38,558 --> 08:29:40,360
many people already that can wait for

13762
08:29:40,360 --> 08:29:43,360
2024 when there's a new hero in the mix

13763
08:29:43,360 --> 08:29:45,398
I also think that we learned a lot at

13764
08:29:45,398 --> 08:29:46,958
this International that we can all

13765
08:29:46,958 --> 08:29:50,280
incorporate in our own games and I'm not

13766
08:29:50,280 --> 08:29:52,680
talking about Des mid though I think we

13767
08:29:52,680 --> 08:29:56,040
might see that as well your head for up

13768
08:29:56,040 --> 08:29:56,878
some

13769
08:29:56,878 --> 08:30:00,238
pubs oh no there's new ways to take the

13770
08:30:00,238 --> 08:30:02,040
the Tormentor down that's something that

13771
08:30:02,040 --> 08:30:03,558
uh that that I learned you can do it

13772
08:30:03,558 --> 08:30:05,958
with Bristol back with his agon you just

13773
08:30:05,958 --> 08:30:07,318
turn your back you can do it with Dazzle

13774
08:30:07,318 --> 08:30:09,160
if you just have cers around and you

13775
08:30:09,160 --> 08:30:11,200
heal the cers and get the armor low and

13776
08:30:11,200 --> 08:30:13,318
everything I'm just I just realized well

13777
08:30:13,318 --> 08:30:15,318
technically Tor he also won the ages but

13778
08:30:15,318 --> 08:30:17,680
he also won the most death torment of

13779
08:30:17,680 --> 08:30:22,798
This Ti he so congratulations

13780
08:30:22,798 --> 08:30:26,920
yay another win win if that's true then

13781
08:30:26,920 --> 08:30:28,440
that proves that the Tormentor is the

13782
08:30:28,440 --> 08:30:30,280
ultimate villain it's the hardest thing

13783
08:30:30,280 --> 08:30:32,638
in Dota to beat because it beat yoro

13784
08:30:32,638 --> 08:30:33,798
there it is the only thing that could

13785
08:30:33,798 --> 08:30:36,798
beat him the Tormentor yeah Tori is too

13786
08:30:36,798 --> 08:30:40,160
strong too Nerf Tormentor op op now I

13787
08:30:40,160 --> 08:30:41,440

13788
08:30:41,440 --> 08:30:43,958

mean very special to be in Seattle I

13853
08:32:57,680 --> 08:33:00,160
mean I also think back in Seattle that

13854
08:33:00,160 --> 08:33:02,238
in itself is amazing but so many people

13855
08:33:02,238 --> 08:33:03,798
tuning in from around the world and N

13856
08:33:03,798 --> 08:33:07,000
Laos set time zones ah who cares

13857
08:33:07,000 --> 08:33:08,638
everybody tuning in at awkward times

13858
08:33:08,638 --> 08:33:10,000
just to make sure that they can witness

13859
08:33:10,000 --> 08:33:12,360
the greatest Doja to have ever been

13860
08:33:12,360 --> 08:33:14,398
graced losta what were your favorite

13861
08:33:14,398 --> 08:33:16,558
moments of this

13862
08:33:16,558 --> 08:33:18,760
International hard to choose you put on

13863
08:33:18,760 --> 08:33:20,958
the

13864
08:33:21,080 --> 08:33:24,040
spot ah I don't know it it feels like

13865
08:33:24,040 --> 08:33:27,360
you know we just had so many things that

13866
08:33:27,360 --> 08:33:29,600
you know made this tournament special

13867
08:33:29,600 --> 08:33:31,558
like there's like the shift in meta

13868
08:33:31,558 --> 08:33:33,440
where we see like shifting each day

13869
08:33:33,440 --> 08:33:35,040
pretty much especially during the main

13870
08:33:35,040 --> 08:33:37,200
event it's what makes this game so

13871
08:33:37,200 --> 08:33:38,600
beautiful you'll think you know what it

13872
08:33:38,600 --> 08:33:40,360
is then someone shows you like a couple

13873
08:33:40,360 --> 08:33:41,840
of hours later that you don't know what

13874
08:33:41,840 --> 08:33:43,200
you're actually playing even these like

13875
08:33:43,200 --> 08:33:45,638
top tier teams they lose in 20 minutes

13876
08:33:45,638 --> 08:33:47,238
because the other team is just better

13877
08:33:47,238 --> 08:33:49,200
like they prepare they don't sleep and

13878
08:33:49,200 --> 08:33:51,318
they you know show you how it's done

13879
08:33:51,318 --> 08:33:53,238
yeah it's also just really fun to watch

13880
08:33:53,238 --> 08:33:54,920
the Players come out on stage and really

13881
08:33:54,920 --> 08:33:56,798
feel the energy energy and you can see

13882
08:33:56,798 --> 08:33:58,798
them just basking in their you know own

13883
08:33:58,798 --> 08:34:00,200
enthusiasm and they're left for the game

13884
08:34:00,200 --> 08:34:02,440
you see them clapping and smiling and

13885
08:34:02,440 --> 08:34:03,680
they feel like they're on top of the

13886
08:34:03,680 --> 08:34:05,200
world there and you can see that and

13887
08:34:05,200 --> 08:34:06,958
that is a special thing to see but I

13888
08:34:06,958 --> 08:34:08,160
guess my favorite moment would have to

13889
08:34:08,160 --> 08:34:11,680
be VP versus bed boom that really long

13890
08:34:11,680 --> 08:34:14,558
75 minute game where kir toch TPS to the

13891
08:34:14,558 --> 08:34:16,520
rocks and dies there and woo that was

13892
08:34:16,520 --> 08:34:18,238
that was one of the good ones a wild one

13893
08:34:18,238 --> 08:34:21,080
for sure the fo of Western European DOTA

13894
08:34:21,080 --> 08:34:22,840
finally we get a bit of China love we

13895
08:34:22,840 --> 08:34:24,398
get a bit of what else we got we Eastern

13896
08:34:24,398 --> 08:34:26,398
Europe and then also this guy the entire

13897
08:34:26,398 --> 08:34:29,878
time he's been pretty good oh oh oh oh

13898
08:34:29,878 --> 08:34:32,840
oh oh oh there we go very very very much

13899
08:34:32,840 --> 08:34:35,440
a lot of dedication coming out from

13900
08:34:35,440 --> 08:34:37,798
there we go I will tell you mine as well

13901
08:34:37,798 --> 08:34:40,398
because uh I was walking around before

13902
08:34:40,398 --> 08:34:42,520
the road to the international playoffs

13903
08:34:42,520 --> 08:34:43,958
walking around and I took the wrong turn

13904
08:34:43,958 --> 08:34:45,920
we went for coffee we did you and me T

13905
08:34:45,920 --> 08:34:48,080
we went for coffee and I told you that I

13906
08:34:48,080 --> 08:34:50,238
knew the way I did not know the way we

13907
08:34:50,238 --> 08:34:52,558
went exactly the wrong way but that did

13908
08:34:52,558 --> 08:34:54,840
mean we were right in front of B Hall

13909
08:34:54,840 --> 08:34:56,520
when we found out we were in the wrong

13910
08:34:56,520 --> 08:34:59,398
place and Ben Roy Hall the place of ti2

13911
08:34:59,398 --> 08:35:01,238
and ti3 a lot of special memories so for

13912
08:35:01,238 --> 08:35:03,878
me that was very special and then I must

13913
08:35:03,878 --> 08:35:05,280
if you're talking about donta the best

13914
08:35:05,280 --> 08:35:06,840
donta 2 I mean the finals were fantastic

13915
08:35:06,840 --> 08:35:09,558
but I must must highlight team spirit

13916
08:35:09,558 --> 08:35:11,440
versus lgd game one yesterday upper

13917
08:35:11,440 --> 08:35:15,200
bracket finals that was intense insane I

13918
08:35:15,200 --> 08:35:16,760
I loved every second of that and that

13919
08:35:16,760 --> 08:35:18,840
was uh that was I think my favorite

13920
08:35:18,840 --> 08:35:20,318
moment I got to watch the last minutes

13921
08:35:20,318 --> 08:35:21,638
also in the arena cuz we thought it was

13922
08:35:21,638 --> 08:35:24,478
over obviously you know 20 minutes ago

13923
08:35:24,478 --> 08:35:26,638
so that uh that was very special and

13924
08:35:26,638 --> 08:35:29,120
seeing team spirit win here again it's

13925
08:35:29,120 --> 08:35:31,718
just there are so many so many wholesome

13926
08:35:31,718 --> 08:35:33,638
moments that this team has and they have

13927
08:35:33,638 --> 08:35:35,600
captured all of them as well they

13928
08:35:35,600 --> 08:35:38,318
capture everything we saw already the

13929
08:35:38,318 --> 08:35:40,680
moment that they won we saw moska FY

13930
08:35:40,680 --> 08:35:43,398
standing with camera in his hand they

13931
08:35:43,398 --> 08:35:46,080
Vlog everything I mean actually if you

13932
08:35:46,080 --> 08:35:47,478
go on their YouTube channel you could

13933
08:35:47,478 --> 08:35:49,280
probably learn every detail that you

13934
08:35:49,280 --> 08:35:51,120
wanted to about any of the players but I

13935
08:35:51,120 --> 08:35:52,398
I do love that about them that they're

13936
08:35:52,398 --> 08:35:54,638
such an immersive team like if you're a

13937
08:35:54,638 --> 08:35:56,360
fan of theirs there's so much content to

13938
08:35:56,360 --> 08:35:58,520
consume you can get familiar with all of

13939
08:35:58,520 --> 08:36:00,000
them so I I do think that's why they

13940
08:36:00,000 --> 08:36:01,478
have one of the strongest fan bases in

13941
08:36:01,478 --> 08:36:03,440
Dota outside of just playing

13942
08:36:03,440 --> 08:36:06,160
solo yeah oh ladies and gentlemen I know

13943
08:36:06,160 --> 08:36:08,080
that there's still a lot of people here

13944
08:36:08,080 --> 08:36:09,798
waiting for late game good is to you

13945
08:36:09,798 --> 08:36:11,840
there's a lot of people waiting in the

13946
08:36:11,840 --> 08:36:14,200
crowd still already for the actual late

13947
08:36:14,200 --> 08:36:16,440
game to watch it live there's a lot of

13948
08:36:16,440 --> 08:36:18,318
people still watching here because

13949
08:36:18,318 --> 08:36:19,600
they're waiting for late game to watch

13950
08:36:19,600 --> 08:36:21,360
it from their homes or from the comfort

13951
08:36:21,360 --> 08:36:23,478
of PB Stomps uh but we're wait we're

13952
08:36:23,478 --> 08:36:25,040
just getting getting ready with late

13953
08:36:25,040 --> 08:36:26,760
game we want to make make sure that the

13954
08:36:26,760 --> 08:36:29,878
moment we tune out you're entertained

13955
08:36:29,878 --> 08:36:31,878
with late game so we we're we're holding

13956
08:36:31,878 --> 08:36:34,760
the four down here as uh well this

13957
08:36:34,760 --> 08:36:36,718
entire tournament we talk about regions

13958
08:36:36,718 --> 08:36:38,840
a little bit there TV I feel like we

13959
08:36:38,840 --> 08:36:40,920
have to continue talking a little bit

13960
08:36:40,920 --> 08:36:43,520
more mostly in regards to the Chinese

13961
08:36:43,520 --> 08:36:46,478
region because I felt like compared to

13962
08:36:46,478 --> 08:36:48,798
last year last year they came top four

13963
08:36:48,798 --> 08:36:50,878
uh fourth with as and that was the only

13964
08:36:50,878 --> 08:36:53,120
team that really did uh incredibly well

13965
08:36:53,120 --> 08:36:54,958
we had lgd still doing okay as well but

13966
08:36:54,958 --> 08:36:56,478
of course that was was a different LTD I

13967
08:36:56,478 --> 08:36:58,920
felt like this was a Resurgence of the

13968
08:36:58,920 --> 08:37:00,398
region no for sure and I think it was

13969
08:37:00,398 --> 08:37:01,878
refreshing throughout the entire year at

13970
08:37:01,878 --> 08:37:03,798
the Mages and stuff we had this like

13971
08:37:03,798 --> 08:37:05,318
kind of just Western European dominance

13972
08:37:05,318 --> 08:37:07,080
the entire time it's why I was happy you

13973
08:37:07,080 --> 08:37:08,878
know that they uh maybe didn't do so

13974
08:37:08,878 --> 08:37:10,558
well this time around cuz I think once

13975
08:37:10,558 --> 08:37:12,558
TI sets a statement to what region to

13976
08:37:12,558 --> 08:37:14,160
look at then the Western European fans

13977
08:37:14,160 --> 08:37:15,558
and the the kind of Western audience

13978
08:37:15,558 --> 08:37:17,200
need to look elsewhere to to absorb

13979
08:37:17,200 --> 08:37:18,920
their DOTA content so uh I think for

13980
08:37:18,920 --> 08:37:20,958
China specifically lgd and then the Old

13981
08:37:20,958 --> 08:37:22,958
Guard of Azu being able to show up at TI

13982
08:37:22,958 --> 08:37:25,120
both get top four was incredible just

13983
08:37:25,120 --> 08:37:26,958
for interational DOTA and also they

13984
08:37:26,958 --> 08:37:29,120
produced one of the my favorite memes

13985
08:37:29,120 --> 08:37:31,520
that DOTA has ever seen you know Lam

13986
08:37:31,520 --> 08:37:33,280
talking about his tee that everything is

13987
08:37:33,280 --> 08:37:35,600
fine against gaming Gladiators and start

13988
08:37:35,600 --> 08:37:37,798
of like this is this is fine and

13989
08:37:37,798 --> 08:37:39,478
everything's burning in the back there's

13990
08:37:39,478 --> 08:37:41,520
like four people dying it's just like

13991
08:37:41,520 --> 08:37:42,958
you know it's going to be one of those

13992
08:37:42,958 --> 08:37:45,238
things I I I was I was watching that

13993
08:37:45,238 --> 08:37:47,160
yesterday and I was spinning water out

13994
08:37:47,160 --> 08:37:49,238
of my mouth through my nose as well but

13995
08:37:49,238 --> 08:37:50,798
we got to give credit to them because

13996
08:37:50,798 --> 08:37:52,440
they played some amazing DOTA reaching

13997
08:37:52,440 --> 08:37:54,718
top four without even trying too hard

13998
08:37:54,718 --> 08:37:56,200
you know we talked about the teams that

13999
08:37:56,200 --> 08:37:57,718
have practiced throughout the year they

14000
08:37:57,718 --> 08:37:59,120
formed and they're like you know what

14001
08:37:59,120 --> 08:38:01,000
we're going to show up at TI and do well

14002
08:38:01,000 --> 08:38:02,958
and they reach top four the Old Guard

14003
08:38:02,958 --> 08:38:04,718
plus some of the new generation of the

14004
08:38:04,718 --> 08:38:06,840
players they did extremely well yeah but

14005
08:38:06,840 --> 08:38:08,958
on the topic of that imagine being Lam

14006
08:38:08,958 --> 08:38:11,520
in that moment I mean you're doing an

14007
08:38:11,520 --> 08:38:13,238
interview and everyone's cheering so

14008
08:38:13,238 --> 08:38:16,000
loudly so you're thinking to yourself W

14009
08:38:16,000 --> 08:38:18,200
love and the cheering gets really louder

14010
08:38:18,200 --> 08:38:20,080
and he go oh I'm on a roll here with my

14011
08:38:20,080 --> 08:38:22,200
answers you he walks down back to the

14012
08:38:22,200 --> 08:38:23,558
Green Room he's looking at the screen

14013
08:38:23,558 --> 08:38:27,318
and just goes 4 and0 ah what we did see

14014
08:38:27,318 --> 08:38:29,638
we did we did hear barle Chala said uh

14015
08:38:29,638 --> 08:38:32,600
on his social media that they were they

14016
08:38:32,600 --> 08:38:34,080
were all laughing at it they were all

14017
08:38:34,080 --> 08:38:35,760
running away from the fight and as

14018
08:38:35,760 --> 08:38:38,478
someone goes kill that

14019
08:38:38,478 --> 08:38:41,718
bear turns around oh this I mean there

14020
08:38:41,718 --> 08:38:43,318
there's going to be a lot of memories

14021
08:38:43,318 --> 08:38:45,120
from this year's International one of

14022
08:38:45,120 --> 08:38:46,798
course I mean that one is a great one

14023
08:38:46,798 --> 08:38:48,360
but the biggest memory will be that we

14024
08:38:48,360 --> 08:38:49,920
have for the second time in Dota 2

14025
08:38:49,920 --> 08:38:53,280
history a two-time champion four new

14026
08:38:53,280 --> 08:38:55,798
players are getting that award and of

14027
08:38:55,798 --> 08:38:59,200
course now also a TI champion and team

14028
08:38:59,200 --> 08:39:01,920
spirit with their Championship a clean

14029
08:39:01,920 --> 08:39:04,080
sweep 3 and0 there's only two other

14030
08:39:04,080 --> 08:39:05,558
times that happened in the history of

14031
08:39:05,558 --> 08:39:07,760
Dota 2 so team spirit will go down in

14032
08:39:07,760 --> 08:39:08,920
history it's one of the most dominant

14033
08:39:08,920 --> 08:39:10,360
teams of all time we'll see if they can

14034
08:39:10,360 --> 08:39:11,878
repeat it next year I know that the

14035
08:39:11,878 --> 08:39:14,318
hunger for these players it just doesn't

14036
08:39:14,318 --> 08:39:17,280
seem to cease at all but that is it

14037
08:39:17,280 --> 08:39:18,600
ladies and gentlemen we're ready for a

14038
08:39:18,600 --> 08:39:20,920
late game so without further Ado I mean

14039
08:39:20,920 --> 08:39:22,520
we we've loved every second of it and

14040
08:39:22,520 --> 08:39:24,798
we've hoped that that we were able to

14041
08:39:24,798 --> 08:39:27,760
convey those feelings to you at home to

08:39:27,760 --> 08:39:29,760

08:39:31,398 --> 08:39:33,040
some other time to experience the same

14045
08:39:33,040 --> 08:39:35,000
thing because it's something special and

14046
08:39:35,000 --> 08:39:38,160

14231
08:52:44,600 --> 08:52:47,920
good TI yeah I think that's about right

14232
08:52:47,920 --> 08:52:49,000
let's just talk about the thing you want

14233
08:52:49,000 --> 08:52:50,318
to talk about let's put all the cards on

14234
08:52:50,318 --> 08:52:53,280
the table here the new hero Shannon what

14235
08:52:53,280 --> 08:52:55,000
do you think about it Suns fan

14236
08:52:55,000 --> 08:52:55,958
yes what do you think about this new

14237
08:52:55,958 --> 08:52:58,398
hero is this puppet master or is it no

14238
08:52:58,398 --> 08:53:00,120
okay I see a a belch sign in the

14239
08:53:00,120 --> 08:53:02,398
audience I appreciate you back

14240
08:53:02,398 --> 08:53:05,878

14241
08:53:05,878 --> 08:53:07,360
can't I don't want to get fired with

14242
08:53:07,360 --> 08:53:09,520
they've already uh denounced my voice

14243
08:53:09,520 --> 08:53:13,080
line many a time anyway uh yeah a lot of

14244
08:53:13,080 --> 08:53:14,398
people seem to think it's Puppet Master

14245
08:53:14,398 --> 08:53:15,760
but the reason they think that is

14246
08:53:15,760 --> 08:53:17,958
because in the files it was called

14247
08:53:17,958 --> 08:53:20,520
Puppet Master but the skills are nowhere

14248
08:53:20,520 --> 08:53:22,200
near the same as for people that don't

14249
08:53:22,200 --> 08:53:25,238
know the heroes of new Earth her

14250
08:53:25,238 --> 08:53:27,000
named Puppet Master which was really

14251
08:53:27,000 --> 08:53:28,840
cool but I do have some inside

14252
08:53:28,840 --> 08:53:31,000
information that's definitely fake go on

14253
08:53:31,000 --> 08:53:34,280
then uh the quote unquote leaked ability

14254
08:53:34,280 --> 08:53:37,160
from years ago is actually a Sur action

14255
08:53:37,160 --> 08:53:40,798
slack ability that he created in our

14256
08:53:40,798 --> 08:53:43,958
custom game called Community hero and

14257
08:53:43,958 --> 08:53:46,798
item project he made basically a virus

14258
08:53:46,798 --> 08:53:48,080
in our game that just destroyed the

14259
08:53:48,080 --> 08:53:49,478
custom game called

14260
08:53:49,478 --> 08:53:53,760
parasite and his ult was to take over

14261
08:53:53,760 --> 08:53:56,318
another hero okay like you take over an

14262
08:53:56,318 --> 08:53:58,760
enemy hero and you can just waste ravage

14263
08:53:58,760 --> 08:54:00,878
but that's not that's not just for the

14264
08:54:00,878 --> 08:54:02,478
that is not anything to do with this new

14265
08:54:02,478 --> 08:54:03,718
hero that's just something that's that

14266
08:54:03,718 --> 08:54:06,478
is a theory no that's your theory there

14267
08:54:06,478 --> 08:54:08,318
is a theory that that is what it is that

14268
08:54:08,318 --> 08:54:09,920
would be a bit strong a lot of theories

14269
08:54:09,920 --> 08:54:13,318
turn out to be true peran that's

14270
08:54:13,318 --> 08:54:15,478
true and a lot of dumb that makes

14271
08:54:15,478 --> 08:54:16,638
it into the game turns out to be a

14272
08:54:16,638 --> 08:54:19,920
Slack's idea like Centaur cart or pocket

to them to know right we give them just

14758
09:18:29,122 --> 09:18:30,878
a part of our like information they

14759
09:18:30,878 --> 09:18:32,200
think about it but we have like a lot

14760
09:18:32,200 --> 09:18:34,598
more so we don't give something special

14761
09:18:34,598 --> 09:18:36,758
like and anyway I think we could give

14762
09:18:36,758 --> 09:18:39,918
more but it's uh I understand it's very

14763
09:18:39,918 --> 09:18:42,598
important for fans right if I would be a

14764
09:18:42,598 --> 09:18:45,078
fan I would like to know how things

14765
09:18:45,078 --> 09:18:48,398
Works uh know much more about team so I

14766
09:18:48,398 --> 09:18:50,640
think it's important thing but you can't

14767
09:18:50,640 --> 09:18:54,718
R everything true of course

14768
09:18:56,800 --> 09:18:58,278
okay speaking of the

14769
09:18:58,278 --> 09:19:01,878
content you guys did smells like team

14770
09:19:01,878 --> 09:19:06,278
spirit Nana was anybody actually playing

14771
09:19:06,278 --> 09:19:07,238
their

14772
09:19:07,238 --> 09:19:10,040
instrument every

14773
09:19:10,040 --> 09:19:12,640
well we get the lie detector back out we

14774
09:19:12,640 --> 09:19:14,640
can get the lie detector we have

14775
09:19:14,640 --> 09:19:17,200
instruments actually yeah we do that's

14776
09:19:17,200 --> 09:19:19,000
true team spirit take over for the band

14777
09:19:19,000 --> 09:19:20,000
that would be

14778
09:19:20,000 --> 09:19:21,800
something all right let's talk about

14779
09:19:21,800 --> 09:19:23,276
your guys team

14780
09:19:23,276 --> 09:19:25,360
because you always look to be when when

14781
09:19:25,360 --> 09:19:26,880
we were I was just watching the just the

14782
09:19:26,880 --> 09:19:29,120
Grand Final even you guys never seem to

14783
09:19:29,120 --> 09:19:30,880
be that far apart you seem to know

14784
09:19:30,880 --> 09:19:33,276
exactly what each other's doing how much

14785
09:19:33,276 --> 09:19:35,596
practice does that take or is it just

14786
09:19:35,596 --> 09:19:37,120
you just play together long enough it

14787
09:19:37,120 --> 09:19:39,276
just becomes second

14788
09:19:39,276 --> 09:19:41,880
nature yeah I think like your second

14789
09:19:41,880 --> 09:19:44,320
version is right like we played a lot

14790
09:19:44,320 --> 09:19:46,916
like for one year and at the start of

14791
09:19:46,916 --> 09:19:50,040
our roster we no our games was not

14792
09:19:50,040 --> 09:19:53,680
really good and we did kind of B

14793
09:19:53,680 --> 09:19:56,800
but now we got a lot of practice and

14794
09:19:56,800 --> 09:19:59,960
probably some good PCH and also we

14795
09:19:59,960 --> 09:20:03,040
found really good ideas how we should

14796
09:20:03,040 --> 09:20:05,160
play with each other how we should use

14797
09:20:05,160 --> 09:20:10,080
each other and yeah yeah fair enough

14798
09:20:10,080 --> 09:20:12,400
Quinn said and I don't remember if this

14799
09:20:12,400 --> 09:20:14,960
is public or not but whatever new be

14800
09:20:14,960 --> 09:20:16,916
this be new patch he doesn't give a

14801
09:20:16,916 --> 09:20:21,560
um you guys are a team that you kind of

14802
09:20:21,560 --> 09:20:23,400
no matter what the patches you play like

14803
09:20:23,400 --> 09:20:26,880
the same roles of in the game you know

14804
09:20:26,880 --> 09:20:29,436
collaps is playing like the Mars type

14805
09:20:29,436 --> 09:20:31,840
Heroes you get in there you do like

14806
09:20:31,840 --> 09:20:33,240
no matter what the patch is you kind of

14807
09:20:33,240 --> 09:20:35,120
do the same thing and when the patch is

14808
09:20:35,120 --> 09:20:36,520
yours you're like really really strong

14809
09:20:36,520 --> 09:20:38,400
on it do do you think that this is one

14810
09:20:38,400 --> 09:20:40,000
of those patches for you like first of

14811
09:20:40,000 --> 09:20:42,276
all is he right about that that you guys

14812
09:20:42,276 --> 09:20:45,640
just fit the same kind of mold on every

14813
09:20:45,640 --> 09:20:47,800
patch uhuh I think's probably playing

14814
09:20:47,800 --> 09:20:52,040
Ina Heros so if he his role has Ina

14815
09:20:52,040 --> 09:20:53,720
Heros we will

14816
09:20:53,720 --> 09:20:56,800
win like Mars Spirit breaker that's a

14817
09:20:56,800 --> 09:20:57,596
fair

14818
09:20:57,596 --> 09:21:01,240
breakdown brist as you can see as coach

14819
09:21:01,240 --> 09:21:02,960
I can say we're trying to use the

14820
09:21:02,960 --> 09:21:05,640
strongest sides from our players just

14821
09:21:05,640 --> 09:21:11,436
that's it okay well honestly I mean

14822
09:21:14,400 --> 09:21:17,400
yeah you think that applies to all DOTA

14823
09:21:17,400 --> 09:21:19,080
pubers out there that you should just

14824
09:21:19,080 --> 09:21:21,160
play to your strengths or should I

14825
09:21:21,160 --> 09:21:22,756
should I go you know learn how to be

14826
09:21:22,756 --> 09:21:24,320
position five cuz I'm too scared to

14827
09:21:24,320 --> 09:21:25,520
carry the

14828
09:21:25,520 --> 09:21:28,400
game yes um you should actually like if

14829
09:21:28,400 --> 09:21:30,120

14830
09:21:30,120 --> 09:21:31,640

14837
09:21:44,720 --> 09:21:46,880
