1. but you called me first anyway.
2. it just came out the wrong way.
3. but I will try my best.
4. but it makes sense to me now.
5. to hear you say that clearly.
6. thanks for reminding me just now.
7. could you please repeat your name?
8. could you say that one more time?
9. I will be there very soon.
10. maybe we can do it another time.

11. until you explained everything in detail.
12. but I am really glad you did.
13. please go on with what you were saying.
14. but I am slowly getting used to it.
15. let us give it a try then.
16. thanks for being honest with me.
17. before I make a final decision.
18. so this is a pleasant surprise.
19. could you walk me through the steps?
20. but here we are right now.

21. could you please say that again?
22. maybe we can talk later instead.
23. time really got away from me.
24. so thank you for getting back to me.
25. right now I honestly do not know.
26. that was never my intention at all.
27. I have been waiting for this moment.
28. but somehow you still noticed it.
29. so I think I should take it easy.
30. but now everything makes sense.

31. until this very moment actually.
32. but I think I will be fine.
33. but I am not giving up yet.
34. so please bear with me for now.
35. but I am really glad you came.
36. even when things get really hard.
37. sorry about that, I had no idea.
38. at least for the time being.
39. but I really hoped you would.
40. so please be patient with me.

41. sorry about that, I lost track of time.
42. maybe someday I will be ready.
43. so I went ahead and did it.
44. just take it one step at a time.
45. but we will adjust as we go.
46. but I am open to your ideas.
47. I really should have asked sooner.
48. little by little, it feels easier.
49. but apparently it really does matter.
50. but I will figure it out eventually.

51. but now I understand where you are coming from.
52. but I know I will get over it.
53. that was never my real goal.
54. please correct me if I am wrong.
55. but I think I will adjust soon.
56. no matter what happens in the end.
57. until you actually mentioned it earlier.
58. but I will let you know soon.
59. but now I finally see it.
60. because that is good news to hear.

61. but it actually feels pretty peaceful.
62. could you explain what you mean exactly?
63. I am really sorry about that.
64. somehow it all starts to make sense.
65. but we will manage it together.
66. I think I need more time.
67. but surprisingly you still did.
68. so I wanted to ask you about it.
69. until you clearly said it out loud.
70. in the long run, it might be worth it.

71. so thank you for letting me know early.
72. even when things are not easy.
73. that was never what I wanted to do.
74. to make sure everyone understands clearly.
75. time really does fly sometimes.
76. and I honestly do not know what to do.
77. but here we are anyway.
78. without confusing anyone involved.
79. but I understand your point now.
80. even though it is not easy.

81. until I actually tried it myself.
82. but I am still giving it a try.
83. but it turned out to be one.
84. it really means a lot to me.
85. honestly, I did not expect that.
86. so I need a moment to think.
87. more than I originally thought.
88. even if it is really hard.
89. but I truly appreciate your honesty.
90. because now I feel much calmer.

91. but I am glad it finally did.
92. right now I feel a bit confused.
93. already, before we even noticed.
94. but it is really not that easy.
95. than I ever expected it would.
96. but I think I really should.
97. but I am glad you did anyway.
98. honestly, I did not see that coming.
99. until just a short while ago.
100. because this conversation really helped.
